Here's a bunch of information on an alleged robbery. Oh, no reason. #Ferguson #MikeBrown|||||@ank_wobl @CheathamKMOV @AntonioFrench misdirection. These guys are magicians.|||||@ank_wobl @CheathamKMOV @AntonioFrench Lol alleged.|||||@CheathamKMOV @AntonioFrench The American people must take the country back from the police employed to PROTECT and SERVE them (allegedly).|||||@CheathamKMOV @SiDonTrip That is what Al Jazeera America just reported too. So why did Wilson shoot Mike Brown?|||||@PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV there is no reason to justify. Perhaps for tha fact they've been gettin away w/ stuff all tha time &amp; can get|||||@PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV away wit this. It's extremely sad|||||@SiDonTrip @CheathamKMOV so many loose ends and unanswered questions. Does not engender trust in alleged facts.|||||@PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV u can tell they were gon tryn concoct a story to get themselves off. Wait 6 days to release cop name then|||||@SiDonTrip @CheathamKMOV yes, the delay and the piecemeal trickle (of unrelated events, even) concerns me|||||@PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV it looks real bad. And they wonder ppl (mainly black) have such a high level of distrust in em|||||@PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV come out saying he was alleged "strong arm robbery" suspect. They must think we're stupid|||||@SiDonTrip @PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV the lie wasn't for you they gave the people who believe we ALL steal what they wanted to hear.|||||@ddizzle2771 @SiDonTrip @CheathamKMOV shoplifting doesn't give any cop the right to play judge, jury, &amp; executioner|||||@PogMoThoin13 @ddizzle2771 @CheathamKMOV exactly. None of it makes sense &amp; NOTHING they can justify tha outcome|||||@SiDonTrip @PogMoThoin13 @CheathamKMOV AGREED!!

U don't shoot anybody w/ hands up|||||@SiDonTrip @PogMoThoin13 @ddizzle2771 @CheathamKMOV I agree but you have no clue that they were. Only witness is his robbing buddy.|||||@hookemJuve @SiDonTrip @ddizzle2771 @CheathamKMOV several witnesses to shooting say he had hands up|||||@PogMoThoin13 @ddizzle2771 @CheathamKMOV it only makes sense.

Parents pointed out his earlier probs|||||@hookemJuve @SiDonTrip @ddizzle2771 @CheathamKMOV if I beat my spouse&amp; no 1 knew, then got shot by cop while walking in street,is justified?|||||@PogMoThoin13 @SiDonTrip @ddizzle2771 @CheathamKMOV no, but I would give you zero sympathy. I've never said it was justified.|||||@hookemJuve @SiDonTrip @ddizzle2771 @CheathamKMOV so for you, the real issue is morality of persons involved, &amp; not the law?|||||@PogMoThoin13 @SiDonTrip @ddizzle2771 @CheathamKMOV The issue is police brutality.|||||@PogMoThoin13 @SiDonTrip @ddizzle2771 @CheathamKMOV The issue is militarization of our police.

Not much of an answer considering how much info he sat on.|||||@tonymess @RevKeithVessell @stltoday to try to convince the public and media he was a violent thug to justify what was done|||||@tonymess @stltoday i could see him thinking that's what the stop was about and why the officer didn't pull his weapon from the start.|||||@tonymess The reason he stopped them doesn't matter if they didn't do what the cop said and fought the cop that ignited the shooting|||||@tonymess Being mad about why they were stopped is silly being mad about how being stopped led to his death is my problem

16	2	Key point: Officer Wilson was not aware that #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect. It will be key in establishing his state of mind. #Ferguson|||||@tjholmes üëèüëèüëèüëè #WeNeedThatVerdict|||||@tjholmes So why did he stop him?|||||@tjholmes #MichaelBrown new that he had just committed a serious crime.  That is key in establishing #MichaelBrowns state of mind.|||||Then why did that officer have contact @tjholmes|||||@tjholmes @MikeKrupka could go to Brown's state of mind though? He maybe thought that's why he was being stopped?|||||@Animaleyz not following why that's important?|||||@MikeKrupka I'm wondering if that maybe contributed to the struggle starting? Of course we'll never know the answer for sure.|||||@Animaleyz from what I gather, he was walking down street, kneeled down with hands in air before being shot. No struggle.|||||@MikeKrupka one video of a guy said he was eyewitness, said they fought in the car, a shot rang, he knelt and was then shot in the head.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka so wouldn't the police car be close to the body in the pics? Or he move the car?|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka that's what I wonder, but this guy says Brown was in the car http://t.co/kDQYGHvZA4|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Yup, I watched that ... absolutely crazy shit|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton only thing I dispute is that the police were called, and were looking for him. But Wilson didnt know about that.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka wouldn't open. But I saw 2 witnesses that said different|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton he said cop passed him walking, put it in reverse, and then got out and shot him multiple times while kneeling...|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton he said at first he shot into the car, Brown got out and knelt, then cop shot him 9 times.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Who shot into the car? I took it that the cop shot into his own car while trying to get out, causing Brown to kneel|||||@MikeKrupka @Animaleyz the cop shot out the car at Mr. Brown, then got out car and shot again|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz yes, that's what I understood|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz http://t.co/KT5LKYXkRU --- try that link Greg|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka ok I got it wrong|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton it sounded ot me like Brown was in the car, a shot, then he got out and knelt. Maybe I'm wrong|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka cop shot while in car. Got out. Mr. Brown then went to knees, shot again|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka ok yea but I see how I misunderstood|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton That's some messed up shit man. Walking down street. Cop goes in reverse. Shoots on way out of car. Then murders kid|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton did anyone mention anything the cop,WIlson, might have said as to why he shot him?|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton I mean witnesses. Did anyone hear Wilson say anything?|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka he's not speaking, and won't speak. Police department and lawyers made sure of that|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz Yup, 5th amendment rights; didn't file paperwork either|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton by writing the report, he'd be providing evidence against himself.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Yup. Question is, which citizens have video evidence? OR better yet, will FBI have ability to pull up satellite cam?|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton what satellite cam?|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton You don't think the FBI can pull up satellite video of any corner of the globe they wanted to?|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton they dont have satellite imagery of everywhere. Thats physically impossible.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton I know it can be done, but you may be right in that the cams would already need to be focused there.|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton if the feds could surveil the entire US and world, there would never be any fugitives.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Not true. Not everything some in open.   They can see what they want, but they need to be focused on the location.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka Plus. 5 mins walking in sandals? That's a lot of room. Plus no cigars found on him. http://t.co/L9HwRk2Wcl‚Äù|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka witness from the video admitted Brown was there. That much I didnt misunderstand lol|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka no. The witness said he was at the corner store, not at the QT. Watch again...|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz Yeah, he was saying it was a different store...|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz I walk in flip flops everyday, that looks like about 6 - 8 blocks or more, no way that's done in 5 minutes walking.|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton IDK what to tell ya, the guy says it clearly. Just says Brown wasnt stealing.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka watch again. You heard wrong|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka well either way it had nothing to do with the shooting, so it's irrelevant|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka clearly says he was at Ferguson Market...|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka where did the robbery happen?|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka quick trip|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka police report says clerk indicated the suspect left and walked TOWARDS quick trip. http://t.co/WcLbN4SARH|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka in the report at 1 point it says a box, another point it says a few packs. (cont) http://t.co/0z8s5osElG|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka but again, stealing cigars imo, arguing with a cop, etc. Hitting a cop, once hands went up, incident over|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka no I get that|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka it just sounds like his friend in the video has bad info of where the robbery happened. Cop went looking for the...|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka robbery suspect at the Quik Trip, but that isnt where it happened. Clerk said suspect left store and went that way.|||||@Animaleyz if out was him, and he was picked up. How much time would he have gotten? 0, first (cont) http://t.co/93Um5qJuLt|||||@agentlinton IDK officers responding to the theft say they never found suspect until he was dead, identified him as Brown and his friend...|||||@agentlinton was there also, seen in video, identified as Dorian Johnson.|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz goes back to stealing cigars shouldn't equal being shot dead, especially since officer had no idea about that...|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton of course not, we've reiterated that. But a Quik Trip was burned down because of this, hope it wasnt a franchise.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka insurance covers a building and the goods inside.|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka if you can get them to cover all the loss. They'll nickel and dime away.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka even if it was a franchise... Or is qt different?|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton didn't know it was burned down? I'm not OK with that at all... still not my main concern or focus.|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton it's a bad situation in many ways. Other innocents affected.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka I will never put any physical property over human loss. Even a car wreck, I say, well at least you're alive.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka but that's me. If I'm wrong then I can live with that.|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka me neither, just saying the situation is bad in many ways.|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka hey is Pierre OK? Wasn't at practice today.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Me @NateUlrichABJ mentioned a knee injury, not sure how serious|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka he'll be fine|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz Thanks, Greg.|||||@Animaleyz @agentlinton Interesting.|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka police report has zip code of robbery as 63135. Only quik trips in the area are 63136|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka Ferguson Farmer's Market is 63135|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka that's BS too imo|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka they said today He didn't even write incident report. Which was weird in itself. Everyone should be fired|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka one thing I disagree with that guy in that video about is Brown didnt look like he did nothing. Grabbed clerk...|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka by the shirt and shoved him, clerk was trying to stop him. But that doesnt justify death by any means.|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka so is it 100% proven that that's him in the video? Guy in video looks 50 pounds heavier to me|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka his friend in the video admitted he was in the store getting cigars, but disputes Brown was stealing them.|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz It could just be "smoke" / lame attempt to shift focus from murder to robbery.|||||@MikeKrupka @agentlinton yea Police chief admitted Wilson didnt know about the robbery.|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz Not favoriting because I like it, but because that's the account I understood to be true as well.|||||@MikeKrupka @Animaleyz so y'all saying 2 different stories. Looking at same video?|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka IDK maybe I'm having trouble understanding him|||||@agentlinton @Animaleyz Greg, try opening in a browser...|||||@MikeKrupka @Animaleyz I seen it yesterday. And talked to people who spoke to him|||||@Animaleyz @MikeKrupka and I call BS on anything they say, and don't believe he was inv the car. How much sense does that even make?|||||@agentlinton @MikeKrupka this is the witness that said that|||||@Animaleyz Lots of eye witness accounts right now, guess to your point earlier, probably won't ever know truth for sure.|||||@MikeKrupka OK I misunderstood it. No struggle, but Brown was in the police car at one point.|||||@tjholmes He left an illness call to take a robbery call in the area, according to the Police Chief. Wrong robbery, wrong robber? Just sayin|||||@tjholmes  THIS LADY SAYS IN THE VIDEO THE POLICE TOOK DOWN SECURITY CAMERAS WHERE MIKE BROWN WAS SHOT https://t.co/iJBFwbjr2t

Those are the facts. #Ferguson|||||.@scATX Reminder,  he is a suspect in a crime and allegedly assaulted a police officer.|||||@scATX Maybe some facts...but you're not telling all of the facts...only some of the story.|||||@scATX You were there? You saw with your own eyes?  I prefer to wait for full truth. If chief is lying, then he should be fired.|||||@caldodge @scATX the chief has now told two contradictory stories. By definition, he is lying in at least one of them.|||||@r4v5 @scATX He could be, or he could have been given bad info before. But given Ferguson history, it doesn't look good for chief.|||||@caldodge @scATX if he's "been given bad info before" and publicly states that bad info, that is called "lying"|||||@r4v5 @scATX Not if he doesn't know it's bad info at the time.|||||@r4v5 @scATX If somebody tells you something that's not true, and you repeat it (because you thought it was truth), does that make you liar?|||||@caldodge @scATX depends on the obligation one would expect you to do due diligence before passing on lies, no?|||||@r4v5 @scATX It's called delegation. Person in charge expects underlings to do gruntwork of due diligence.|||||@r4v5 @scATX I'm not asserting police chief IS telling truth. I'm saying he COULD have thought story was truth at time.|||||@r4v5 @scATX Jose Guerena case shows cops may lie to deflect blame. Guerena's family won lawsuit, but Tucson sheriff won reelection anyway.|||||@scATX he committed a robbery then punched a cop in the face, those are facts|||||@RMoronie no they are not.|||||@MichelleHux yes, they are. The photos of him match the police report|||||@scATX @rgay can you say "Trayvon Martin?"|||||@xtx33 @scATX seriously|||||@rgay @xtx33 how many names could we say?|||||@scATX @xtx33 far too many|||||@scATX @rgay üò•|||||@scATX @MaraWritesStuff - unpopular opinion incoming. Would this have been as big, if the police officer was dead instead?|||||@Gorbles @MaraWritesStuff What is your point?|||||@scATX - because making an emotive tweet on a tragic death isn't the best presentation of it. I doubt it'd have been done for the officer.|||||@Gorbles An unarmed kid was shot dead in the street, his body left for hours, and the police keep changing the story. EXCUSE MY EMOTING.|||||@Gorbles why the fuck does it matter what would be done if it had been the officer? IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN; THE KID WAS UNARMED.|||||@Gorbles you wanting to change the story to make this about the not-dead or not-even-injured or not-arrested cop is ridiculous derailing.|||||@scATX - sorry for that impression, I don't want to make it about the officer. I want objective views, not emotive tangents. Nothing more.|||||@Gorbles idea that anything can be "objective" is false. And the idea that "emotion" somehow means "not trustworthy" = WHATEVER|||||@scATX - Twitter's crap at letting me get it all out decently. Basically, reminding people someone's dead is pointless. Everyone knows (1/2)|||||@Gorbles it's not pointless. And fuck yeah, I am leveraging my opinion. It's my Twitter account. I should apologize for this?|||||@scATX - not at all, sorry again. I'm offering my opinion like you were offering yours. That's all. I didn't even expect a reply!|||||@Gorbles surprise!|||||@scATX - you're in a position of authority, and you're using that to leverage this view. Just my opinion, I'm not the only one to reply.|||||@scATX @Gorbles This. we are made up of emotion. Objective is often a code for male/real/white.|||||@JulieGillisTX @scATX - we are indeed, but ya need to consider things without emotion sometimes. Judges don't rule on emotion!|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX hahahahahahaa sure ok, player|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX I think you really need to study "objectivity" and question that concept.|||||@scATX @JulieGillisTX - sure thing. I'm young, I've got plenty to learn.|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX @scATX yeah, definitely no "emotion" in the way the criminal justice system pursues alleged cop killers either.|||||@dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - definitely a huge problem. The biggest problem here though is a lack of transparency all round.|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX @scATX don't know what your point is. People are emotional when someone's shot. If it's a cop, cops are emotional.|||||@dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - original point was lost somewhat, no worries. People are emotional, never disputed that.|||||@Gorbles @JulieGillisTX @scATX when it's a kid, people who empathize with kids are emotional. There is no emotion-free perspective.|||||@dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - when observing the situation, then you have to have more of a clear head.|||||@dansolomon @JulieGillisTX @scATX - not that I ever stated what my feelings on the #Ferguson situation was. Death is awful.|||||@Gorbles @scATX If you really think that you need to go back to school. Everyone absolutely does, unless they are sociopathic.|||||@JulieGillisTX @scATX - if a judge ever sent someone to prison because the judge didn't like the defendant, then that's unlawful.|||||@JulieGillisTX @scATX - deciding without emotions on occasion != devoid of emotions (sociopathy).|||||@JulieGillisTX @scATX @Gorbles his profile states 100% dolt. we have our answer.|||||@meadowgirl - in joke, community-related. It's funny how quick people jump to insults though :/|||||@Gorbles waaaa waaaaaa poor widdle white dude feefees. yawn. don't make it about emotion! suck it up!|||||@meadowgirl - I'm not. It's funny. Having to resort to personal attacks in order to bait some kinda rise.|||||@Gorbles yes, yes bc you are clearly the smartest, best and more deserving of humanity. yes, we know white man, it is about YOU here.|||||@meadowgirl - more about me than you, given the attention I'm getting. Peace out.|||||@Gorbles @scATX Not sure why you think anybody gives a fuck what you "want".|||||@Philosopher_Dad - nor you. Personal attacks aren't the best way to conduct yourself, yo.|||||@Gorbles Yo, go fuck yourself, yo.|||||@Gorbles also it's not an opinion.

Shoplifting, maybe, but robbery??|||||@decyberdiva @MichaelaAngelaD It's a robbery the second you touch an employee. W/out weapons it's strong arm robbery.|||||@slow17motion @MichaelaAngelaD Oh so now we're making up terms to suit murdering an 18-year old for shoplifting.|||||@slow17motion He paid for them. Why delete that part of the video??? http://t.co/vw7MoLcwty|||||@decyberdiva If he paid for him, why would his friend admit they stole them? LOL. I often admit to crimes I never committed.|||||@slow17motion http://t.co/vw7MoLcwty|||||@slow17motion It's easier for U to believe a lie than the truth/video. The store didn't report a robbery. No weapons. http://t.co/vw7MoLcwty|||||@decyberdiva Johnson admitted it. Brown violently shoved the clerk. End of story.|||||@slow17motion He paid for the cigars. End of story.|||||@decyberdiva You're one dumb bitch. lol|||||@slow17motion You're an idiot and a racist!

(that's an ACTUAL fact).|||||@slow17motion Fact: the surveillance video shows him paying for the cigars.

Then there's this! (lol) https://t.co/neYdc8crRD|||||@slow17motion No robbery. No weapons. Sorry. I don't believe an unarmed 18 year old should be shot for shoplifting either.|||||@decyberdiva It's robbery if you touch a person in the store.|||||@slow17motion since when? Since Michael Brown was shot? Strong-armed robbery is robbery using a weapon.|||||@slow17motion There's no such animal as a "Strong-arm" robbery.|||||@decyberdiva Um. Yes there is. It's a legal term.|||||@decyberdiva http://t.co/izQFOzrZYp|||||@slow17motion This isn't remotely what happened in this situation.|||||@slow17motion Robbery is theft using threat of DEADLY Force.|||||@decyberdiva No--it's not. You're obviously not a lawyer.|||||@slow17motion LOL. Now that's funny!|||||@slow17motion Yes, it it. For it to be robbery, there must be fear of deadly harm.|||||@decyberdiva This is pointless. Just look it up. I'm through here.|||||@decyberdiva Theft is the ABSENCE of force. Robbery is any application of force, even a nudge can bump it from theft to robbery.|||||@slow17motion Oh, please!|||||@decyberdiva http://t.co/4wEg4RzlS8|||||@decyberdiva QUOTE FROM WEBSITE: Robbery is a violent crime, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the victim has to suffer any type of injury|||||@slow17motion The operative word here is violent. I never said a word about an injury. I said FEAR.|||||@decyberdiva So you're arguing that the legal definition of robbery vs. theft is contingent upon the victim's "feelings" LOL|||||@decyberdiva You said the threat of DEADLY FORCE is required. It's absolutely NOT.|||||@slow17motion Absolutely. Fear of violence doesn't mean being pushed. Give me a break.|||||@decyberdiva It's an act of violence. So, yes, that's included under FORCE.|||||@decyberdiva Actually, even if he HADN'T pushed him, if he took something then WALKED HIM DOWN, that's still robbery. Research is fun.|||||@slow17motion Great. See you in court.|||||@decyberdiva I'd hope so, you're a hot mess.|||||@slow17motion If I walk into a store and say give me all of your money or I'll push you‚Ä¶.that's a robbery???? PUH-leaze.|||||@decyberdiva It's a threat of violence AND you're taking something in the person's control. Yes, that's robbery.|||||@slow17motion Hey, we define violence differently. And of course, depending on who's doing what, we'll label it differently.|||||@decyberdiva (I'm not defining it. I'm letting the LAW define it. That's why I'm giving sources...)|||||@slow17motion You know, like the boys sleeping in the car in the video I posted were plotting a robbery, according to 9-1-1 calls.|||||@decyberdiva Two issues: Stereotyping shouldn't ever occur. Stereotypes are not always baseless. (The second one makes me racist, right?)|||||@decyberdiva Let me give you an example. Many people think all gay men are lisping, mincing fairies. I'm not. However--it's not baseless...|||||@decyberdiva ...many gay men are lisping, mincing fairies.|||||@decyberdiva If you're a police officer--you're not supposed to use racial profiling (or security at an airport)... However, there is reason|||||@decyberdiva to profile. Who's more likely to blow up a plane? A middle aged man of middle eastern decent--or a 95 year old white woman?|||||@slow17motion except for the 9-1-1 bombers had European passports, dyed hair and didn't look middle eastern.|||||@decyberdiva http://t.co/pKdeR46ED6 Unless they completely changed their faces, they looked middle eastern. lol.|||||@decyberdiva What I'm getting to is this. 1/11 black men are in prison. 1/45 white men are in prison. 11-12% of Americans are black. They|||||@decyberdiva make up 40% of the prison population. It's not COMPLETELY absurd that cops would use these statistics and profile.|||||@slow17motion MOST crime is committed by whites. Blacks go to jail more often than whites for the same offenses.|||||@decyberdiva True. Whites are the majority of the population.|||||@slow17motion indeed.|||||@decyberdiva Regardless of the reasons, though--black men are still statistically much more likely to commit crime. Hence profiling.|||||@decyberdiva Sad? YES. Unfair? ABSOLUTELY. Logical? Well..yeah.|||||@decyberdiva Blacks go to jail more often. Also true. That could account for some of the discrepancy. However, even if it counted as HALF of|||||@decyberdiva the discrepancy, that would still mean a black man is twice as likely to commit a crime as a white man.|||||@slow17motion Sorry. Faulty math there.|||||@decyberdiva No, it's not. If 1/11 black men are incarcerated vs. 1/45 white men, that means that 10% of black men are imprisoned. 2% white.|||||@slow17motion That only proves what I said earlier, that black men are arrested and convicted for situations white men get away with.|||||@slow17motion You can't supposed from that any greater propensity for crime. Sorry.|||||@decyberdiva Actually... You absolutely can. Mathematically it's true. I don't think melanin has anything to do with it though.|||||@decyberdiva I argue that economics and a culture that glamorizes crime have to do with it.|||||@decyberdiva Also, the war on drugs increased all incarcerations significantly.|||||@decyberdiva I discounted HALF of those crimes for reasons you mentioned: 5% black men vs. 2% white men.|||||@decyberdiva So, in a way you're right. An individual black man, statistically would be MORE THAN TWICE as likely, discounting 1/2 of crimes|||||@slow17motion Nope. Not true. Sorry.|||||@decyberdiva You don't like math?|||||@slow17motion Statistically, since there are more white people and they commit the majority of crime...|||||@decyberdiva Yes, we're talking PERCENTAGES though.|||||@decyberdiva If you're talking about profiling, you're talking about likelihood, that mean's PERCENTAGES.|||||@slow17motion you are more likely to stumble across a criminal by targeting white men.|||||@decyberdiva No, you're not. If you took 100 white men and 100 black men, statistics show only TWO white men would be criminals. (10 black)|||||@decyberdiva Yes, there are MORE white people. But that is irrelevant to the point I'm making.|||||@decyberdiva Are there MORE white criminals? YES! There are WAY MORE WHITES. Are they more LIKELY to be criminals. NO. Not by a longshot.|||||@slow17motion http://t.co/8qlF5e78HE|||||@decyberdiva everyone knows that white men tend to get killed by white men and black men by black men. Not new.|||||@slow17motion Great. This entire exchange started over my comment about using black-on-black crime as a subterfuge. http://t.co/7Kc7443cQL|||||@decyberdiva what are you talking about?|||||@decyberdiva you really aren't very good with deciphering our giving meaning to statistics|||||@decyberdiva ask yourself why black on black crime might be a focus of media attention and white on white crime isn't.|||||@decyberdiva the answers are all there in the statistics. All you need to do is think about them.|||||@decyberdiva of interracial crime, blacks commit 85%. Many times more likely to commit homicide. Black on black violence is a problem...|||||@decyberdiva disproportionately, black men commit violent crimes. It's a problem that needs a solution. Hence the media focus.|||||@slow17motion stop the lies...|||||@slow17motion the way to fix this is to stop stripping the wealth from black communities|||||@slow17motion disproportionately property values are devalued in black communities, disproportionately black incomes are predominately less|||||@decyberdiva read up http://t.co/o48Popxfuw|||||@slow17motion this is nonsense. this is why my children need protection from twisted thinking like yours.|||||@decyberdiva Regardless of the reasons, there are more black criminals. It's not exactly a lie. I mentioned economic factors.|||||@decyberdiva You wonder why property values are lower in black neighborhoods? See earlier statistics.|||||@slow17motion Sorry. Devaluation came before crime.|||||@slow17motion Sorry. I know better than this. THe lies don't work with me.|||||@decyberdiva You can blame the gov't, the economy, schools, whatever. In the end, you have to acknowledge that violence is a PROBLEM in...|||||@decyberdiva ...black communities. Nobody is going to ride in and save them. They need to save themselves. The best way is to change the...|||||@decyberdiva ...cultural values in these communities, reduce drug use and gang influence, and encourage higher education.|||||@slow17motion YOu watch way too many movies. Don't believe every music video you see.|||||@slow17motion This is the lie perpetuated by the right.|||||@decyberdiva You didn't find this funny? http://t.co/89RVxg90RZ|||||@decyberdiva http://t.co/Yup745DrDu (The source I meant to post.)|||||@slow17motion http://t.co/d8v2Aghvjd|||||@decyberdiva You post one european-centric white supremacist website and EVERYBODY thinks you're a racist. #jokez|||||@slow17motion http://t.co/FpYYu9CDnx|||||@decyberdiva It's about PERCENTAGES (profiling is ALL about percentages)|||||@slow17motion You can twist percentages around to mean a lot of things.|||||@decyberdiva No, this is pretty cut and dry. It's not statistics from disputed studies of small populations. This is from census data.|||||@decyberdiva Every man and woman should be judged as an INDIVIDUAL. Every man and woman has the right to due process--regardless of race.|||||@decyberdiva This includes ALL black men...and yes, Darren Wilson too. Being a policeman is not an easy job and they're easy to demonize.|||||@decyberdiva How about we wait to demonize this one until the facts are in? If he's guilty--demonize away.|||||@slow17motion Not demonizing. However, paid leave is hard to stomach.|||||@slow17motion And there's a history of problems in Ferguson that go beyond one incident.|||||@decyberdiva Blacks make up nearly 1 million of the 2.3 million prison pop. in the US. That's 6x more than whites. Statistically, it has|||||@decyberdiva been predicted that 1/3 black men will spend time in prison during their lifetimes. (Most for non violent drug offenses.)|||||@decyberdiva I am an advocate for short term sentences for non violent offenders and legalizing marijuana. I dislike profiling immensely.|||||@slow17motion Not for legalizing marijuana at all. sorry.|||||@decyberdiva I've never tried marijuana--but I know from personal (family) experience, that it doesn't ruin life quite like booze.|||||@slow17motion Alters brain chemistry, mood altering, kills memory, brain cells..|||||@decyberdiva Of course it's mood altering. That's the point. Brain cells are not killed. At worst it increases the speed at which the brain|||||@decyberdiva deteriorates with age. The most respected studies show that THC does NOT kill brain cells with daily or even heavy use.|||||@slow17motion Psychiatric effects of cannabis | http://t.co/1U6EXQFuQT|||||@slow17motion Psychology Today: Marijuana addiction is real | http://t.co/03TaRfyAI0|||||@decyberdiva It's as real as any mental addiction. It's not physically addictive.|||||@slow17motion Marijuana, brain disorders and schizophrenia | http://t.co/TMpOON12i5|||||@slow17motion  All of the experts agree it causes the amotivational syndrome and decreases memory...http://t.co/DTqolqYxZu|||||@decyberdiva It's ironic you'd cite one very biased source to show ALL EXPERTS AGREE (they don't).|||||@slow17motion 10 Reasons to stay away from weed. 8.

Adults should have access.|||||@decyberdiva 10. People are nicer on weed. Fact.|||||@slow17motion Nope. Not a fact. Weed causes permanent personality changes and can cause irritably and aggressiveness.|||||@slow17motion American Medical Journal: Pros and cons in one post | http://t.co/VNG1E3GD1P|||||@decyberdiva Nobody is arguing that marijuana doesn't have some negative effects. It's still better than booze, which is legal.|||||@slow17motion Again, I disagree.|||||@decyberdiva Honestly, the negative effects are minimal and manageable if used with caution and care.|||||@slow17motion Sorry you need to tell this to someone who hasn't seen the opposite first hand.|||||@decyberdiva I've known plenty of potheads that function just fine and are active, intelligent people.|||||@slow17motion thats like saying i know plenty of alcoholics that function just fine..|||||@decyberdiva THC is like anything else--if you abuse it, it's going to have negative effects. Same with booze, cigs, fatty foods, etc.|||||@decyberdiva It's actually healthier than cigarettes (which are physically addictive, THC is not), and it does less damage than booze.|||||@decyberdiva However, I understand why it is used.|||||@decyberdiva Much of it has to do with economics.|||||@decyberdiva Economically, black men tend to be more likely to live in poverty.|||||@decyberdiva No, it's not RIGHT. It's stereotyping--but it makes logical sense. Sad but true.|||||@decyberdiva Well, it's robbery once something is taken.|||||@decyberdiva If you walk into a store, shove the clerk, and take a candy bar. It's robbery. If you take the candy bar and sneak out, theft.|||||@slow17motion Ah, but he didn't walk into the store and shove the clerk.|||||@slow17motion He didn't walk into the store and threaten the clerk either.|||||@slow17motion He walked up to the register. There doesn't seem to be any altercation at the counter.|||||@decyberdiva You're making suppositions. Fact is, it's unclear. Johnson doesn't dispute a crime happened. All sources reporting (like|||||@decyberdiva dailykos) are trash. It looks like a strong arm robbery to me. You disagree. We should move on from this.|||||@slow17motion LOL. Suppositions? You mean like the ones you're making?|||||@slow17motion You're right. These are suppositions! &amp; they shouldn't matter. The policeman didn't know anything about the convenience store|||||@slow17motion We see the same things and yet see different things. That's human nature and that's the problem here.|||||@slow17motion That is why there is such unrest in Ferguson right now. Because I never know when what you're seeing isn't what I'm seeing.|||||@decyberdiva There's unrest because the popular narrative is that a white police officer gunned down a young black man for no reason.|||||@slow17motion Ummm. Gunned down an unarmed man. The reason matters little.|||||@decyberdiva (And for a smaller percentage of protesters there's unrest because, hey, who doesn't love flat screens?)|||||@decyberdiva Doesn't mean that's what happened. We don't KNOW what happened.|||||@decyberdiva It‚Äôs enough to commit a robbery if you use any type of force to take property from someone|||||@slow17motion Please. This is what happens when you believe your own eyes...http://t.co/Bcu22RBBiN|||||@decyberdiva Okay, so where in the video is he paying?|||||@decyberdiva Do we know why the clerk bothered pursuing him? Why pursue if he paid?|||||@decyberdiva a clerk and a customer. The customer has unbagged items in his hands and the clerk is pursuing. Brown shoves the clerk then|||||@decyberdiva walks him down. That's what I see. Sorry.|||||@decyberdiva your info from DailyKos. lol|||||@decyberdiva bullet. However, we don't actually KNOW what happened yet between Wilson and Brown. Hopefully investigation will get answers.|||||@slow17motion we know a cop shot an unarmed 18 year old at least six times.|||||@decyberdiva So? That doesn't mean it wasn't justified. Cops shoot unarmed people all the time if they are threatened. It's justifiable.|||||@slow17motion meanwhile James Eagan Holmes shoots 82 people in Aurora and is taken alive...|||||@decyberdiva Erm...Okay? (Unrelated...)|||||@slow17motion actually it's very pertinent. try this one. It gets to the point quicker...https://t.co/aYtF48WTDa|||||@decyberdiva Using this as evidence for the Brown case is a logical fallacy called 'faulty generalization.'|||||@slow17motion ROTFLMAO. Yeah right. Easy to say when the generalizations aren't being made about you.|||||@decyberdiva Err... First of all... It's an actual LOGICAL FALLACY (it's a philosophical term). Second of all, it's a fallacy that...|||||@decyberdiva ...discredits generalizations.|||||@slow17motion Lets be real, if Justin Beiber was shot for shoplifting cigars from a convenience store we'd be taking about excess force.'|||||@decyberdiva Let's be real... It has a lot to do with the threat a person poses. Bieber = minimal threat. Guy who is angry and 6'4"...|||||@slow17motion Justin or Wynonna...|||||@decyberdiva I had a co-worker whose son was shot because he was committing an unarmed robbery. Justifiable. (And the shooter was civilian.)|||||@decyberdiva not a fact: I'm a right winger because I believe in due process. You seem to think that anyone who doesn't agree with you...|||||@decyberdiva ...is a racist republican. That's called a stereotype, which is actually much closer to racism. Let me give you another fact.|||||@decyberdiva fact: I'm an independent who has never voted republican. I'm a minority who doesn't have rights you likely take for granted|||||@slow17motion I'm an ex-Republicann now Independent, who doesn't like tea party nut jobs and I take my rights extremely seriously.|||||@decyberdiva I've never been a Republican, never voted for a Republican, and have ALWAYS been an independent. As a gay man, I also take my|||||@decyberdiva rights very seriously.|||||@decyberdiva are you so desperate for him to have been an angel? He wasn't. He was an asshole. It's sort of beside the point though.|||||@slow17motion You knew him personally? Oh, right. You just built all of this up in your mind.

96	2	Looks like #Ferguson PD spent their whole week on a smear campaign against #MikeBrown instead of investigating or being at all helpful.|||||@itsthatseanguy|||||@itsthatseanguy Yeah especially how they got a dead guy to pose for PICTURES "pretending" to rob someone????|||||@itsthatseanguy @alexachula they blew it. Simple fact checking blows their story up. The robber wore shorts/sandals. Mike had pants/gymshoes|||||@buffblkwell my bf tryna tell me that was him. Saying his shoes and clothes match.

We still need facts.|||||@EricAle60758866 @Heritage You think Mike Brown confessed while they were (allegedly) fighting? Or after he got shot?|||||@DrewLudwig @Heritage That's the only scenario you can imagine? Possible radio call came during stop, or Brown went for gun thinking (1/2)|||||@DrewLudwig @Heritage stop was related to robbery. Again, not excusing either...we need more facts. Period. (2/2)|||||@DrewLudwig @Heritage Has more to do with WHY he would have attacked the cop for just telling him to get out of the middle of the road.|||||@marker98 @Heritage yeah. Its a much safer bet to attack a cop, instead of stepping onto sidewalk.|||||@DrewLudwig @Heritage Yea, not a lot of rocket science going on with that decision.|||||@marker98 @Heritage We don't know. One self-interested witness says that happened. Multiple witnesses say it didn't. No official report yet.|||||@marker98 @Heritage Funny how quickly they got info together on the robbery, but haven't had time to collect evidence on the shooting.|||||@DrewLudwig @Heritage Now THAT part is self interested. CYA|||||@Heritage Has absolutely nothing to do w/cop shooting him dead when his hands were up.Cop didn't know about this. Smarmy to bring it up, HF.|||||@scrivener50 @Heritage Helps explain why Mr Brown would attack the cop for telling him to get out of the middle of the road though.|||||@Heritage yeah but he didn't fill him full of lead! He was a thug that deserved justice. These pigs should be slaughtered!!!|||||@mitchelldavenpo @Heritage   How do you know is hands were up?|||||@idesignwis @Heritage I know he was unarmed. Hands up or not it doesn't give a cop the right to kill!!|||||@mitchelldavenpo @Heritage   How many cops have been killed with they're own gun?  If you don't know the answer, shut up.|||||@idesignwis @Heritage I  You're right, killing people that scare you is totally justifiable, as long as you have a gun AND a badge.|||||@mitchelldavenpo @Heritage   Nice to see an idiot who thinks he knows the answers before all the facts come out..:)|||||@idesignwis @Heritage aren't you doing the same thing but on the other side of the issue?|||||@mitchelldavenpo @Heritage   How, by not believing everything the media spouts? LOL|||||@idesignwis @Heritage no, by thinking you know what has happened before the facts come out. To bad we can't hear the cigar thief's version.|||||@mitchelldavenpo @Heritage Not just a thief, also a strong arm thug.|||||@idesignwis @Heritage fine he was a thug. Does that mean he should be killed?!? A badge doesn't make a man judge, jury, &amp; executioner.|||||@mitchelldavenpo @Heritage   I'd wait for the facts before calling someone an executioner....|||||@idesignwis @Heritage I would but you can't trust the police.

Aren't you?|||||@CatsAndAlpacas @024601 Sort of. We should not have any of the information from the investigation. It hinders a fair trial.|||||@CatsAndAlpacas @024601 1, the cop is a murderer... 2 the cop was defending his own life.  A big difference and you weren't there.|||||@burkej4 @024601 He was surrendering with his hands up, yet he was shot to the point of death|||||@burkej4 @024601 and because he committed this crime, rather than be arrested, he was killed.|||||Well that makes a bit more sense.

Time to stop smokin I guess http://t.co/8ZkvrHkApc|||||@YourAnonLive @JillJhorvath The property would have been valued by store employee not cops. Retail cost as determined by business.|||||@YourAnonLive Could've been a 60 count box which are ~$40. Box like this: http://t.co/HnBy8k86GG|||||@nickk330 @YourAnonLive If he stole a case of cigars, where were they?|||||@iRondrea if they have the box it would be in evidence, but that's assuming this isn't just fabricated to create an excuse for the cop|||||@iRondrea @nickk330 @YourAnonLive they have the whole thing on video..|||||@GdurhamGarrett @iRondrea @YourAnonLive you have a link? or you just taking their word for it?|||||@iRondrea @nickk330 @YourAnonLive it was on the news where I live.|||||@GdurhamGarrett @iRondrea @nickk330 ok, have you seen the video?|||||@YourAnonLive Actually it's pretty reasonable. Maybe do research before tweeting to the masses? http://t.co/gFeDyb1RrY|||||@InfectiousChris lmap research before tweeting? pfft if anything this entire mess had showed research is the last thing people use|||||@PancakeBreasts Anon has been pretty awful through this whole thing.|||||@InfectiousChris I meant in general. People went off the deep end and believed the 1st thing they heard or read. No matter how 1 sided|||||@PancakeBreasts Oh for sure.. Anon has been exceptionally awful though!|||||@YourAnonLive You should be focusing on the ROBBERY charge and not the SHOPLIFTING charge.|||||@YourAnonLive @JillJhorvath The key here is the verbiage Theft,burglary,larceny, or Robbery? Robbery is the term in this report!|||||@agentbell4272 @YourAnonLive why robbery..whats the difference between shoplift or robbery..I have not read report yet|||||@JillJhorvath  Robbery involves threat or the use of force or violence to take the property|||||@agentbell4272 right.  So he did that for cigars ? I know I need to sit and read report.   What's your thoughts on sll this|||||@YourAnonLive @OpFerguson that's also not a robbery in most jurisdictions, it's a petty theft. (Eg Los Angeles)|||||@bonedog84 @OpFerguson @YourAnonLive I stole gum from a drugstore as a kid. Glad Im alive to tell it.|||||@YourAnonLive @OpFerguson no signatures?|||||@DeuceTony @YourAnonLive @OpFerguson I bet they just typed that up this morning.|||||@mskturner10K @YourAnonLive @OpFerguson right.

Mike Brown is suspect #1.  Please read everything out there.|||||@jlrehmer @OpFerguson @YourAnonLive  Good look! Thank you!|||||@von_Steiner @OpFerguson @YourAnonLive You're welcome!|||||@YourAnonLive @JayTheQuad it also says they didn't arrive on the scene for the first time until 8/13|||||@YourAnonLive @OpFerguson so not even a felony... Haha|||||@YourAnonLive @OpFerguson $50 ?! Shit.. Mane this is some nonsense the report don't even look right. Missing info allat|||||@YourAnonLive @toddwurdd Items Stolen: 1 - Items Recovered: 0 - Fatally Shot Suspects: 1...|||||@freewebcamporn @YourAnonLive man. in so heated over this|||||@YourAnonLive @FrancoisKilljoy for real.. I buy a box for 15 bucks.|||||@YourAnonLive I think perhaps they‚Äôre saying the entire wholesale box a store would use for display‚Ä¶as opposed to one package.|||||@YourAnonLive @euIVmusic WHY does the time stamp say 11:51 on the report, but one of the stills of the robbery shows 11:53?

This is just absurd and reeks of fish!|||||@Lawrence @deepdimlpes  they also suggest not talking with witnesses? I see no way to get a real accurate idea of what happened. by design?|||||@Lawrence Good shooting or bad, when was medical response requested? Did he even call for it? Did any of the witnesses? #factsplease|||||@Lawrence what we do know is that MB had a propensity to get physical with people.|||||@Lawrence Is it illegal for the officer not to fill out a report after he shoots a suspect?|||||@Lawrence "Lawyers for police ... often advise shooters not to write reports or even speak to commanders or investigators" explains a lot|||||@Lawrence but the department responded to the FOIA by claiming those are closed records under MO 610:100, so some record actually exists

240	2	#ferguson police engaged in character assassination to cover up actual assassination. you. simply. don't. shoot. unarmed. teenagers. EVER.|||||. @thelittleidiot you don't shoot unarmed PEOPLE ever. #fixedthatforyou :)|||||@KelleBelleCa @thelittleidiot Really? what about a rape victim being assaulted by an unarmed man?That may change your opinion.Never say ever|||||@LjSmyth so you'd risk missing the offender and shooting the rape victim instead? Way to go, glad you thought THAT through. You're blocked.|||||@KelleBelleCa I'm talking about the victim protecting herself. You block everyone who has a diff opinion? That's mature.|||||@KelleBelleCa And if someone breaks into your home while you sleep you can't shoot until you know he's armed? You actually can under the law|||||@thelittleidiot If they're physically overpowering you and a reasonable person would conclude your life is in danger, you probably should|||||@jdrch @thelittleidiot If YOU have a gun, someone runs FROM you, DROPPED TO THEIR KNEES W/ARMS RAISED...HOW IS *YOUR* LIFE ENDANGERED?!?|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Categorically for what you described you're correct. But that's not what happened with Brown, there was a struggle|||||@jdrch @thelittleidiot There was no struggle. The armed officer was yards away from someone who was on his knees with his arms raised.|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot That depends on whose account you believe. I'd take the account of an office over that of a thief, but hey|||||@jdrch @thelittleidiot And I wouldn't take the word of a White, armed, police officer whi shot an unarmed, surrendering, person.|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Well now you're prejudging based on race, which puts you in the same boat as the one you claim he's in|||||@jdrch @thelittleidiot Me prejudging on race is waaaaaay different than you prejudging on race. That's just the way it is. Sad, but true.|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Who is "you?" I'm black. Or did you miss that part? And racism is racism. Period.|||||@jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot You talk about taking an officer's word over his "friend" ignoring that there are MULTIPLE eyewitness|||||@FR_INC @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot yeah there are multiple eyewitness accounts of a confrontation too, from what I read|||||@jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot accounts that contradict the story you choose to believe. Are you implying that all residents of that|||||@jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot neighborhood are predisposed to being untrustworthy, criminal sympathizers?|||||@FR_INC @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot You said that, I didn't.|||||@jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot where did you hear these accounts to the contrary? Because every major new outlet I've seen reinforces|||||@jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot the fact, by way of eyewitnesses, that he was a number of feet away with hands in a surrender position|||||@jdrch @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot when the bullets were discharged. And I didn't say anything, I was asking if that's what YOU were implying.|||||@FR_INC @TallGrrl @thelittleidiot No, I wasn't implying that.|||||@FR_INC @jdrch @thelittleidiot That's not the same as not being automatically trusting of police.|||||@TallGrrl @FR_INC @thelittleidiot It's a federal case &amp; civil rights investigation now, so we'll find out what's what.|||||@jdrch @FR_INC @thelittleidiot I really, really hope so. In this and other cases across the nation. Thanks for the discussion!! : )|||||@TallGrrl @FR_INC @thelittleidiot np!|||||@jdrch @thelittleidiot Privilege has its perks. It allows you to automatically take the word of the police, regardless of the situation.|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Well if I'm being robbed who do I call: residents, or 911?|||||@jdrch @thelittleidiot Of course you call the cops...and, since you're Black, I know you  pray they do right by you like they should.|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot My house was robbed multiple times growing up. I know who we turned to. And it wasn't our neighbors.|||||@jdrch @thelittleidiot So, you haven't had a negative experience with police...yet. May the odds be ever in your favour, sir.  ; )|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot I've had 1 in South Dakota where I was pulled over for "speeding" coming from my hotel, but I got a warning|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Aside from that, no one's harassed me per se. But I know my experience isn't everyone's|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot *thief's friend, I mean|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot That said, all of this is hypothetical since the #Ferguson PD still hasn't told us exactly how struggle started|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot Also, I said "reasonable person," which is a standard term #SCOTUS often defaults to.|||||@TallGrrl @thelittleidiot So, in the case you mentioned, a reasonable person would NOT conclude their life was in danger :)|||||@TallGrrl @jdrch @thelittleidiot It's not... unfortunately that never happened. No evidence of that. On their knees? hands raised? really?|||||@thelittleidiot unarmed != not dangerous. An unarmed Chuck Liddell will still beat you to death.|||||@jdrch @thelittleidiot Even Chuck Liddell can't harm you while running away or at a distance with his hands up. #Ferguson|||||@crimghost @thelittleidiot True!|||||@thelittleidiot Even if they grab for your gun?|||||@thelittleidiot @cdotarthur You weren't there you have no idea what happened.|||||@Sector7CA yea but i knw being a black male , hw ive been treated in the past by police whn i hadnt done nuthin either. sooo|||||@thelittleidiot  Racism and fear pulled the trigger.|||||@thelittleidiot Ever. Had. ur ass kicked by 300 lb Teenager?|||||@thelittleidiot Last time I checked 19 is an adult.and yes you can shoot an unarmed adult IF they try to take your gun. that's the law.sorry|||||@thelittleidiot So tell your body guards when a violent man runs full steam at you next time! #LearnTheFacts before you unload on #Twitter.

They don't all know each other and they're all saying the same things.|||||@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Ok, so you get accounts from the community he lives in where people already have a distrust in police|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 why don't you check out the racial profiling statistics of the Ferguson PD? some real, hard facts.|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 That right there tells me you are going into this with an agenda.|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 that I don't like racial profiling and think police should obey the law? That is definitely my agenda.|||||@Tom_sveb @jlpauk @rui_xu @flavius217 LOL|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 No that you see this as a racial situation before you know anything.|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Rand Paul, yesterday:  "Anyone who thinks race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 country is just not paying close enough attention."|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Anybody who uses it at every opportunity falsely weakens the message.|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 who says it's false? There's a large &amp; documented history of this PD arresting too many blacks.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Rand Paul used those words BECAUSE of this incident. Just fuck off dude. Fuck off so hard.|||||@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 You're making an assumption about something based on other peoples actions, that's my point.|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 then tell me the people of Ferguson haven't EARNED some distrust.|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Right there you just admired they are all bad witnesses if they have distrusts in cops.|||||@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 and you want to make a decision without any hard facts.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 You don't want to see what's happening? Fine. Keep being naive. Good day.|||||@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 I see a lot of people making assumptions with limited facts. We haven't even seen an autopsy report.|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 autopsy report SPOILER alert: died from multiple gunshot wounds|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Was he shot in the chest or back? From 35' away or 3' away? Which wounds came first?|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 everyone agrees he was shot once at close range and multiple times at 30+ feet.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 They've already said he shot him once from the car. Christ.|||||@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running.|||||@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest how was he running away?|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 in your world, it's cool to shoot unarmed people in the chest, but not the back? Or vice versa?|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the back he was running away but shot in the chest he could have been charging.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Yeah, I would totally expect a kid that's been shot to run away, get shot again, and decide to charge.|||||@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Has that info came out yet?|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 confused how an unarmed person, charging, retreating, or standing still, is a threat to a cop 30' away|||||@Tom_sveb @jlpauk @rui_xu @flavius217 Simple: Mike Brown was Inspector Gadget.|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Did you see him stand 30' away and get shot? No. A few people who have a problem with cops did.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu do you not even have a basic understanding why people mistrust police?|||||@flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu I do, but do you have a basic understanding of the judicial system? Let's hear both sides then decide.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu dude, come on. This rogue cop apparently thought he was Judge Dredd and murdered an unarmed kid.|||||@flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu So no matter that evidence comes out during the investigation that's what you're going with?|||||@jlpauk @flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants UNSUBSCRIBE|||||@jlpauk @spants per chief belmar: "a shot was fired inside the car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle."|||||@Tom_sveb @spants And there was a struggle inside the car. How do we know Brown didn't get the gun and fire the shot during the struggle?|||||@jlpauk why would the ferguson PD and STLCO PD release the information they've released and fail to mention that?|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 that's an account FROM THE STL CO POLICE CHIEF|||||@Tom_sveb @flavius217 I blocked him, so you can leave me off the tweets. I won't see them, gives you more characters.|||||@spants @flavius217 ok|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 I'm relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses.|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 They didn't say who fired the shots in the car. The fact is we've only heard one side.|||||@jlpauk there's a difference between an open mind and an empty one|||||@Tom_sveb An open mind waits for all the facts then decides. An empty one makes a decision before the investigation is over.|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 they've systematically only released information that makes them look good, even info that might taint|||||@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 What other info do they have ready to release? All they have said is this is why we approached him.|||||@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery?|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 an investigative report on the shooting?|||||@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 the investigation (e.g., that officer had a facial injury).|||||@rui_xu @flavius217 They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info.|||||@rui_xu @flavius217 They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them.|||||@flavius217 I'm curious, had the suspect been white would the PD have acted the same?|||||@dissuade p sure you know the answer to that question.|||||@flavius217 And that's the point. That's what people are upset about, I think.|||||@dissuade it's also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars.|||||@flavius217 Agree. Not worth the bullets whatsoever.|||||@flavius217 Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community.|||||@dissuade I believe I read something like Ferguson is 29% white but the PD is 94% white.|||||@flavius217 White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops. We are a guilty till proven innocent society.|||||@dissuade strongly agree. I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals.|||||@flavius217 Perhaps they need to alter/improve their training.|||||‚Äú@flavius217: It appears that #Ferguson PD are trying to assassinate Mike Brown's character after literally assassinating Mike Brown.‚Äù|||||‚Äú@flavius217: It appears that #Ferguson PD are trying to assassinate Mike Brown's character after literally assassinating Mike Brown.‚Äù|||||@flavius217 this turned out to be a very popular tweet|||||@FortClank it sure did.

278	2	Educated guess: possible reason they didn't release shooter's incident report--he didn't write one on advice of his lawyer. #Ferguson|||||@Lawrence Is that legal?|||||@I8uridea4brekki its called the fifth amendment to the US Constitution. You may have heard of it.|||||@Robertwaldeck That is about testifying against yourself, not carrying out your duties as a police officer.|||||@Robertwaldeck otherwise, every police incident report could be combed through by a lawyer so that no officer could ever implicate themself.|||||@Lawrence You're so smart, @lawrence.|||||@Lawrence Here I had the na√Øve notion (echoed elsewhere I see) that non-filing a shooting incident report is a HUGE no-no.|||||@cskendrick 5th amendment right|||||@Lawrence but under the law can they release a redacted police report written by unnamed officers?

Who are these people?|||||@Lawrence seems like that's reason enough for discipline in and of itself. Perhaps criminal. That's not an option, mr fife!|||||@Lawrence @pixiecita If that's the case, does that make the lawyer culpable?

279	2	Just did a google map search. There are 2 Quick Trips in #Ferguson and they are on opposite ends of the town. Did #MikeBrown teleport?|||||@DreadlockDipset Sure did.

BS!|||||@rolandsmartin initially, but found out about the robbery during the altercation|||||@rolandsmartin may be prudent to ask clerk if Brown was the one who hit him|||||@rolandsmartin It's a conniving way to do a smear campaign.

You don't see why some1 is more outraged abt cops ("serve &amp; protect") killing w/ impunity?|||||@chicagosprts @ProfessorCrunk Both types of tragedy result from same systemic oppression, but 1 grp is supposedly accountable &amp; is NOT.|||||@BrianDominick @ProfessorCrunk we don't know if the shooting was justified yet but do know no homicide in Chicago is justified|||||@chicagosprts @ProfessorCrunk You know the details of every homicide in Chicago? Wow. Ok, you're not gonna get this. Ur not my audience thx|||||@BrianDominick @ProfessorCrunk yes homicide by definition is the unlawful killing of another in other words unjustified|||||@chicagosprts Actually you're thinking of murder. Homicide is just one human killing another under ANY circumstances. You're a smarty, eh?|||||@BrianDominick u r correct, so why isn't there more outrage over the 500 murders in Chicago|||||@chicagosprts Are we in a loop? Asked and answered.|||||@BrianDominick in Chi plenty of murders no one is held accountable and the murder remains unsolved|||||@chicagosprts Yes, but gangs are by definition not accountable. The cops aren't supposed to be just another gang &amp; they have systemic pwr|||||.@chicagosprts &amp; w/ police shootings unlike common crimes it's not "unsolved" it's UNRESOLVED. The system wins by default.|||||@BrianDominick yet this officer will face first an independent review of the incident and then criminal charges if found unjustiifed|||||@BrianDominick so how is officer not being held accountable|||||@chicagosprts In the Ferguson case? The protests are to ensure the shooter is held accountable. We shall see. So far, so bad.|||||@BrianDominick the protests are fine but to condone looting is ridiculous|||||.@chicagosprts It's not the pt. It's never been the pt. The pt is to have a sense of proportion &amp; context &amp; history. https://t.co/DB1rNOeCAt|||||@BrianDominick cause of the crazines going on another man is dead a women shot in the head sounds it's insane not to condemn them|||||@chicagosprts Not sure who isn't condemning them. But if you believe we have a democracy then our govt agencies shd be answerable to ppl.|||||@chicagosprts No one even pretends gangs &amp; petty criminals are answerable to communities. &amp; the power difference is MASSIVE.|||||@BrianDominick in the picture Brittney says I will not condemn them.|||||@chicagosprts She does. Neither will I. I have more important things to condemn. &amp; I validate righteous rage. Can't help it.|||||@BrianDominick @chicagosprts righteous rage isn't destroying other people's stuff.|||||@BrianDominick @DamnPatriot and righteous rage has led to another dead and 1 shot in head so...|||||@chicagosprts @DamnPatriot Yes, keep blaming the victims. Never the cops. Always the victims.|||||@BrianDominick blame the police protest, but people r destroying their community leading to death and destruction cause of "righteous" rage|||||.@chicagosprts Better righteous than whiteous. Classic white supremacy: https://t.co/NfYwuX6OLj|||||@BrianDominick @chicagosprts he's already lost the argument using sophistry in his definition of victim. Best to move on from the deranged.|||||@DamnPatriot @chicagosprts Yes, plz troll somebody else now, both of you.|||||@BrianDominick @DamnPatriot yep I'm done when someone uses made up word whiteous no use having conversation with that|||||@BrianDominick and what I'm getting at is there should be this type of outrage and time someone is killed|||||.@chicagosprts But that's just the thing: u &amp; I don't get to decide what outrages oppressed communities. https://t.co/urFBeaWiom|||||@chicagosprts @BrianDominick No, a murder by someone tasked with ensuring the safety of others, and entrusted with a great deal of power ...|||||@chicagosprts @BrianDominick ... and discretion, is not comparable to one committed by some random yahoo. That's just dumb.|||||@BrianDominick @ProfessorCrunk never said police arnt accountable for their actions|||||@chicagosprts You didn't need to say it. It's an objective fact. Your approval not required. Play again?|||||@BrianDominick I just wish there was more outcry on the violence in Chicago, to which we know is mostly over money gangs and drugs|||||@BrianDominick So your tweet is about how it's appropriate to ruin someone's business cuz you're angry about something????|||||@SafeWordApples Yeah, you obviously get it. Why don't you read the linked article. And I love your phrasing: "angry about something".|||||@BrianDominick ‚úãI'll leave you to look like an idiot on Twitter. Hope you make the difference you're craving. But I doubt it.|||||@SafeWordApples You're adorable on Twitter! I wish I could have as many followers &amp; as much wisdom as you.|||||@BrianDominick Aww-so cute.You do fail at sarcasm though. Look forward to you tweeting about some SOB stealing from you one day. Fun times!|||||@SafeWordApples @BrianDominick but its just about only a few ppl taking advantage of just a lil opportunity. It's ok|||||@Stonevoodo I do forget that some condone behavior like that. They actually go out of their way to make excuses for behavior like that.|||||@BrianDominick @PeteDominick @ProfessorCrunk See the point but can't get behind the actions. Business owners were not guilty of anything|||||@angryNavy8404 @PeteDominick @ProfessorCrunk Nobody asked you to get behind anything but the outrage. Support that first, foremost, loudest|||||@BrianDominick @Patricialicious @ProfessorCrunk there was no looting last night. Type facts asshole #JusticeForMikeBrown|||||@loudmouthfauth I think maybe you need to learn to read a wee bit better.|||||@BrianDominick ok enlighten me on what I have missed plz|||||@BrianDominick guess that was too hard of a question. Thx buddy #Ferguson|||||@loudmouthfauth What question? You haven't asked me a question.|||||@loudmouthfauth You're attacking me for attacking looters? I think we're on the same team &amp; maybe you just didn't read closely?|||||@BrianDominick 9 ppl arrested 7 weren't from #Ferguson. 1 from texas.

That's all|||||@loudmouthfauth @DavidSc18653023 @BrianDominick The will because they don't want to deal with the real issue of police abuse|||||@BrianDominick @ProfessorCrunk Truly stupid argument.

I was letting that asshole's statement stand on its own merits|||||@BrianDominick "lol" - you may want to drop the illogical, wrong. pc arguments.|||||@alexsimonelis But why? It's so much fun pissing off ignorant racist fucks like you who have no arguments just assertions. #TimeOfMyLife|||||@BrianDominick "What a well-articulated case you make." :-)|||||@BrianDominick @alexsimonelis I'm afraid you don't know what the word racist means, that you wield about so freely.|||||"@DamnPatriot: you don't know what the word racist means, that you wield about so freely."  Sez guy who tweeted Zimmerman = innocent.|||||@BrianDominick and in fact he was, unless you have a racial ideological axe to grind, clouding your rational thinking abilities.|||||.@DamnPatriot I do have such an axe to grind against a system of oppression &amp; injustice. re Zimmerman "innocent":  https://t.co/3n3uplhmiA|||||.@DamnPatriot You are a race patriot, I am a race traitor. We're not likely to agree. Maybe troll elsewhere now?|||||@BrianDominick  race patriot? No. I'm for justice. If those cops did it I want them imprisoned. The only racism is coming from you.|||||@BrianDominick  @ProfessorCrunk Oh sure, mob behavior is always justified and righteous and looting is so productive to the cause.|||||@BrianDominick @ProfessorCrunk A-freaking-men!|||||@BrianDominick no sir I just RT'd it. I believe ur right we r both on the same side. Sorry for my quick response. Emotions are high|||||@loudmouthfauth No problem brother. Fucking Twitter, amiright? #Solidarity!|||||@BrianDominick ppl crying racism will b quick to think we r the enemy cuz of r skin.  Anger is fueling and they don't no where to direct it|||||@loudmouthfauth That's something we have to risk tho. We'll be protected bcz of our skin.Many can't say as much.

That‚Äôs my issue as well.|||||@TomMLemon @markbland why?|||||@AdmireLaniya__ @markbland It‚Äôs an aggressive chant‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt consider that a peaceful protest. It just escalates things. In my opinion|||||@TomMLemon @markbland because there's a curse in it? I'm assuming.|||||@AdmireLaniya__ @markbland Yeah‚Ä¶ and now I sound like an old man now. lol. It‚Äôs just media will use that and make the protest look worse|||||@TomMLemon @markbland who cares? Only if you let them. Don't feed into respectability politics if you know what they are.|||||@AdmireLaniya__ I just want the media to stop making St. Louis look like such an awful place. :(|||||@TomMLemon you know it isn't. Many others know it isn't. Only the brainwashed, mainstream media dependent do and there's no helping them.|||||@AdmireLaniya__ Sad, but you speak the truth‚Ä¶|||||@TomMLemon thanks. You seem like a nice guy, don't let them make you think cursing should evoke aggressive actions by police, of all people.|||||@TomMLemon or discredit the validity of the protest.|||||@TomMLemon Blame the media, not the protesters.

As for the subsequent shooting, I have no idea.|||||@anthxeria The video would show Brown's state of mind. "Holy shit, I just robbed a store, now this cop is rolling up on me!"|||||@drawandstrike and your point is|||||@anthxeria It explains why Brown would assault the officer.|||||@drawandstrike does it expalin why the officer shot Brown 2-3 times while brown's hands was raised?|||||@anthxeria No it does not, if that is what happened.|||||@drawandstrike let me ask you a question: what do you think happened?|||||@anthxeria I think a cop tried to find out why Brown &amp; friend wouldn't get out of the middle of the street, started to exit his car.|||||@drawandstrike please continue...|||||@anthxeria Brown, having just robbed a store, threatened a clerk, thinks he's about to be arrested for that, assaults the officer.|||||@drawandstrike and?|||||@anthxeria Faced with a huge 300 pound 18 yr old grappling with him, in surprise the officer likely went for his gun.|||||@drawandstrike  continue...|||||@anthxeria He &amp; Brown wrestle over the sidearm.

It's believed the officer emptied his gun.|||||@anthxeria That's what I think happened. Based on what I know so far.|||||@drawandstrike what you just described cannot b presented in court as Michael Brown's mindset because he is no longer with us it speculation|||||@anthxeria Forensic evidence has come a long way.

People who want to believe this cop just rolled up on this kid &amp; decided to execute him need to deal.|||||@drawandstrike well if the cop emptied his gun while Mike's hand was raised in surrender then it was an execution regardless|||||@anthxeria The initial narrative about Zimmerman turned out to be far different once the facts came out in court.|||||@drawandstrike the facts remained the same in the Zimmerman case, Georgie chased Trayvon,got his azz kicked and shot and killed trayvon|||||@anthxeria Following some1 in public is not illegal. Also, the narrative was Zimmerman was beating on Trayvon, not other way around.|||||@drawandstrike is running after and chasing some1 with a loaded gun illegal? As Georgie admitted he did|||||@anthxeria And a struggle ensued over the handgun while Trayvon was kicking Zimmerman's ass.

Tray clearly attacked creepy ass zim.|||||@anthxeria @drawandstrike I mean your language insulates you from even comprehending reality.Deserve2die?as if random execution like J Dredd|||||@anthxeria @drawandstrike and FWIW, details of Brown shooting are all over place, no real judgment but that he did just strong arm that guy.|||||@joeindc44 @drawandstrike can I ask you a real serious question?|||||@anthxeria @drawandstrike oh lord...fine, only if I can grade your question on how serious it actually is.|||||@joeindc44 @drawandstrike my question is what is the best detergent to use to clean white sheets?|||||@anthxeria @drawandstrike you're stupid.|||||@joeindc44 @drawandstrike seriously is it Wisk,Fab, Clorox with beach?|||||@anthxeria @drawandstrike uh huh, so when you decide to play the punching game, do you choose pregnant women or the elderly?|||||@joeindc44 @drawandstrike LOL|||||@anthxeria @drawandstrike if you were going to murder a family bc their teen daughter turned down your advances. sledgehammer? ball peen?|||||@joeindc44 @drawandstrike what are you talking about?|||||@anthxeria @drawandstrike can I ask you serious question?|||||@joeindc44 @drawandstrike of course|||||@anthxeria @drawandstrike Are you fucking stupid or just completely bat shit insane?|||||@joeindc44 @drawandstrike is that a retroicial question?|||||@anthxeria @drawandstrike because if it's "why do cops choose to murder innocent ppl for just doing nothing etc. etc." that's stupid.|||||@drawandstrike @anthxeria   Trayvon Walked away ...for FOUR Minutes..  ..then came back to  Show How ‚Ä¢Bad‚Ä¢ He Was|||||@anthxeria You recall the initial narrative about that shooting?|||||@anthxeria A huge hulking white racist jumped out of his car, ran down, tackled, beat up, then cold-bloodedly executed a small child?|||||@drawandstrike Georgie admitted chasing trayvon with a loaded gun when he was told not too georgie even said the kid was running from him|||||@anthxeria He admitted to FOLLOWING Trayvon.

It should serve as a cautionary tale for going with a story before all the facts emerge.|||||@drawandstrike The DA botched that case and had no intention of convicting Georgie|||||@anthxeria The officer thinks he's dealing with a guy who just won't get out of the middle of the street.

In fact, the cop's trying to stop them from walking in the street|||||@anthxeria @larryelder The cop doesn't even know about the robbery.

But if u do X, u may eat lead.|||||@anthxeria @larryelder All this surveillance video shows is that the officer had a valid reason to try to arrest Michael Brown.|||||@anthxeria @larryelder We just had 5 days of people screaming there was no reason whatsoever for this cop to be hassling him.|||||@drawandstrike @larryelder officer Wilson didnt know anything about the robbery|||||@anthxeria @larryelder @drawandstrike better than being a racist like yourself.|||||@This_is_Th3_End @larryelder @drawandstrike once again you feel #MichaelBrown caused his own death|||||@anthxeria @This_is_Th3_End @drawandstrike Never said that but that's what you wanted to hear. http://t.co/mNPzyPqnAF|||||@larryelder this is disgustingly dismissive and insensitive...ugh

512	3	Right now the United States has a stronger militarized force in #Ferguson, Missouri than it does in Baghdad.|||||@WillMcAvoyACN Isn't that the truth! It is shocking how militarised police forces have become!|||||@WillMcAvoyACN Well, considering there are no troops in Ferguson, what's your point? Other than mindless hyperbole?|||||@shelleypowers never said troops. Our troops don't have gear that good.|||||@WillMcAvoyACN Bull. Most of what we see on the police is _protective gear_. Unless you really want them vulnerable to thrown objects?|||||@WillMcAvoyACN I suppose that does make a better story, even for a fake news reporter. "Police killed in riots!"|||||@shelleypowers Yep. Protective. Right. http://t.co/XSR5XkyzZi|||||@WillMcAvoyACN What do you see? Tear gas mask. Helmet. Face Shield. Body armor.. Communication device. And yeah, a rifle and a side arm.|||||@WillMcAvoyACN Going into a potentially dangerous situation, where the day before several businesses were trashed and a station set on fire|||||@WillMcAvoyACN What did you expect to see? Pink bunny slippers and a daisy?|||||@shelleypowers I don't expect to see men dressed in more gear than our troops in warzones all with their guns drawn on an unarmed man...|||||@WillMcAvoyACN How are they to know he's not armed. What were the circumstances leading up to that photo? You don't know the story.|||||@shelleypowers who is voluntarily raising his hands in the area. That's what I don't fucking expect.|||||@shelleypowers I really don't buy it from a police department that somehow can afford all this gear but doesn't equip cars with dashcams.|||||@WillMcAvoyACN They are _not_ from Ferguson. They are the County Swat team.

But then, you are a fake persona, so not unexpected|||||@shelleypowers @kimby55 @UniteBlue That's what gun folks tell me all the time. The brandish a gun so they don't have to use it.|||||@WillMcAvoyACN @kimby55 @UniteBlue The "gun folks" also think it's fine to walk into stores with guns, which is equally absurd.|||||@WillMcAvoyACN @kimby55 @UniteBlue Your slam against Ferguson having a swat team but no dashcams is being RT, when it's completely false.|||||@shelleypowers @WillMcAvoyACN @UniteBlue I did not say they didn't have dash cams. I'm sure they do..merely suggested excuse for them.|||||@WillMcAvoyACN @kimby55 @UniteBlue But you won't correct it, because you're all popularity and pushing the right buttons.|||||@WillMcAvoyACN @kimby55 @UniteBlue You are everything that is wrong about Twitter. I have no time for fakes w/ no integrity, no honesty.|||||@shelleypowers Does pointing a gun at someone make them react differently than had they would have otherwise? Then it's being used.|||||@WillMcAvoyACN OK, you win.

You have a brain, use it|||||@tariqnasheed 1/2 What's the solution? Assume that ALL white people &amp; cops are racist &amp; preach distrust based on the actions of a very few?|||||@scottkutach you have 2 strikes already. Strike one, u start off debating something that was never said. strike 2 your page is a troll acct|||||@tariqnasheed I'm asking a legit??|||||@scottkutach but no one said that..so you are arguing against something u made up|||||@tariqnasheed A black man is 96% likely to die at the hands of another black man, not the cops or a white man. How do we stop that?|||||@scottkutach there u go..I was waiting on the trolling to begin..good day|||||@tariqnasheed if you have a show tonight let me call in not enough characters to tweet This dude really just gave a bs stat from Fox News|||||@scottkutach the same way you stop the 93% of whites killed by other whites..|||||@tariqnasheed FBI stats say black on white crime is 14x that of the opposite. I'm simply asking you "what is the solution" to all of this.|||||@scottkutach those stats are incorrect.because they don't count how law enforcement commits murder against the Black population..|||||@tariqnasheed @tariqnasheed You think a few actions of cops would change stats that contain THOUSANDS in the sample/study? #mathishard|||||@scottkutach so are u saying Blacks are more prone to crime?|||||@tariqnasheed No, I'm saying let's be reasonable and not let the actions of the few define everybody in that group.|||||@scottkutach again,what should happen to all these cops harming Blk people? Or SHOULD they be punished in your opinion?|||||@tariqnasheed Everybody who breaks the law should be punished.|||||@scottkutach what should be done about law enforcement committing murder against unarmed Black people?|||||@tariqnasheed Punish them on a case by case basis based on the facts of the case. Refrain from labeling an entire group of people.|||||@scottkutach so what should be the punishment for all these white cops beating up and killing unarmed Black people?|||||@tariqnasheed The same for anybody that commits murder as proven in a court of law.|||||@scottkutach provide a link where you have spoken out against white cops who commit murder unjustly? A link to the tweets will suffice|||||@tariqnasheed I'm supposed to have issued a press release about EVERY type of crime ever committed in our history? Doesn't make sense.|||||@scottkutach besides trying to derail the conversation about the ferguson shooting,what's your overall point? Your trolling is all over|||||@tariqnasheed I already made it. You just don't want to see that people can treat each other with respect.|||||@tariqnasheed Sound fair to you? On the flip side, I'll practice what I preach and won't label entire groups either. That's fair.|||||@tariqnasheed @scottkutach too fucking bad dude when your people decide to judge us all we have the right to retaliate|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed Have I judged you? Who are "my people"? I'm not assuming anybody is "your people".|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed don't talk like your clueless you know damn well what I'm talking about. Profiling of black men is real|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed Is the disproportionate amount of black on white crime "profiling"?|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed no such thing for all I know profiling of black men has been going on for centuries so I'm not tryna hear that|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed you need to stop acting like you don't know how this system is structured. Keep it real|||||@scottkutach @joshjcharles when Black people get caught committing crimes against white people they usually go to jail.No paid leave 4 them|||||@tariqnasheed @scottkutach exactly this guy actually thinks we all have equal rights|||||@tariqnasheed @joshjcharles My point is..labeling entire groups benefits neither of us gentlemen. Handle stuff case-by-case.|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed well then you need to talk it up with your people cause they started all this shit worldwide not just in America|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed I'm not responsible for the actions of others or unrelated people and neither are you.|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed well then I'm not responsible for the crimes committed by other who look like me yet we are constantly profiled|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed EXACTLY. You're not responsible for those crimes that's why I'm not asking you to "talk to your people".|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed you missed the part about being profiled for it which can cost your life kinda like Jordan Davis|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed On the same note, I'm not responsible for any perceived "profiling". Only those involved are. Get it?|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed profiling is real it's not a fucking game dude|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed If so, I'm still not responsible for the actions of others and neither are you. Right?|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed no but what you can do is hopefully understand why some folks feel the way they do|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed I never said I didn't but it's a 2 way street. Both sides may have legit gripes. But individuals are..|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed you know what I'm not gonna argue I just hope black folks burn that city to the fucking ground|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed What if that kills other black folks? That makes those doing it more dangerous &amp; damaging than the cops.|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed nope it sends the right message to them. We gotta stop tolerating bullshit from then period. Especially blacks|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed It's kinda hard to elevate yourself above these cops you're speaking against when you call for burning the city.|||||@joshjcharles @tariqnasheed still responsible for their actions, not entire groups. I've met shitty ppl from all walks of life.|||||@scottkutach @tariqnasheed I'm not a happy go negro people have the right to fight back fuck this shit I'm tired of it|||||@tariqnasheed Troll acct? No. You're sidestepping honest debate.|||||@tariqnasheed no they are not you moron. The inner city thug mentality puts these cops on edge. Fix the cities there is your solution.|||||@truthnotguilt 43 followers huh ? You guys are getting lazy with your trolling accounts|||||@tariqnasheed trolling? No ones trolling you dip shit. I don't even know who you are. Just opened this|||||@tariqnasheed It's sad how incredible true this is.|||||Thatvmayvbebrhe single most asinine tweet I've read all year.

At least there is truth in what I said. @tariqnasheed|||||@TheStormCro they are the new version of the KKK and they are worse because they are LEGALLY allowed to kill Black citizens.|||||You have no idea what your talking about.

What about the officer who murdered Eric Garner? Has he been arrested?|||||Killing someone in self defense isn't a crime. That seems to be what happened here. @tariqnasheed #Ferguson|||||@TheStormCro so you are saying that all these Black people DESERVED to be killed,correct?|||||I just said we don't know the facts yet. We have multiple conflicting reports. Theres no reason to believe race was involved. @tariqnasheed|||||@TheStormCro So its not about race? Please name me ONE CASE of a Black cop on duty killing an unarmed white teen..Just ONE CASE|||||http://t.co/KmfuJmRd9Y @tariqnasheed|||||@TheStormCro @tariqnasheed how many gun shots does it take to claim self defense??|||||Case by case basis. How many times have you had to defend yourself with a gun? @River_temz @tariqnasheed|||||@tariqnasheed @TheStormCro Danny I love down the street from what happened, the cop shot him from his police car, there is no self defense|||||I truly doubt you are being honest. Unless you were there and saw/heard everything it doesn't matter either way. @Bleuy2010 @tariqnasheed|||||@TheStormCro and you were not a cop,so please don't lie on twitter.If u were a cop,provide a link that proves it.If u deflect,u are trolling|||||Ohio Peace Officer academy class BAS 09-058, graduated sept.

You sir are part of the problem.|||||@Karnythia @sparkygoat The police dogs were there before they picked to body of the ground.|||||@MinoWarrior @Karnythia maybe it was a K-9 unit that had the time to go for backup?

Go away.  @Karnythia|||||@MinoWarrior  what is the problem with the dog? Dog didn't shoot the guy. Everyone is missing the point. I don't agree with the shooting|||||@sparkygoat yeah you do.

I have better things to do than indulge your fantasies.|||||@MinoWarrior I did not say that.|||||@sparkygoat @Karnythia What you're describing is property damage.

I can tell u looting you own town is wrong|||||@sparkygoat @Karnythia Just stop the false equivalency between violence and property damage it doesn't justify the militarization of cops|||||@akittell maybe you could walk out there in flip flops and a tank top ask them to stop burning down gas stations.|||||@sparkygoat @akittell and there it is. You can't dress up ignorance and bigotry for too long.|||||@HeyLynn617 @akittell not that at all. All I said was riot wasn't solving nothing.

So you wouldn't mind me sticking you up for cash?|||||@AlbertKropp @Karnythia sure I would, still wouldn't make looting violence|||||@Ishfery @Karnythia What about lighting someones store on fire? Does that become violence?|||||@AlbertKropp @Karnythia against their person? Not everything bad is violence.|||||The cops decided the protest was a riot &amp; then made sure to escalate @AlbertKropp or did you miss the dogs &amp; tear gas?|||||@Karnythia The cops didn't decide that the local convenience store and shoe store needed to be looted. That happened away from police.|||||Looting isn't violence @AlbertKropp. Still doesn't explain the dogs or the weapons. But keep excusing police brutality.

Please enlighten us.|||||@dreveillark @divineem @Karnythia @WilbotOsterman An 18-year-old is legally an adult. That's the legal threshold. Maturity doesn't matter|||||@fateisonmyside @divineem @Karnythia @WilbotOsterman I was not aware that "kid" was a legally defined term.|||||@dreveillark @divineem @Karnythia @WilbotOsterman then at what point does a kid become an adult? when you want to define it?|||||@fateisonmyside @divineem @Karnythia @WilbotOsterman Dude I believe the term you are looking for is "minor." "Kid" is obvsly subjective.|||||@dreveillark @divineem @Karnythia @WilbotOsterman Yes that is my point tho.

Orange, TX Police Officer Robert Arnold|||||@ricky_raw @tariqnasheed (who has a history of violence) shot and killed unarmed James Whitehead. Arnold is black. Arnold was not in his|||||@ricky_raw @tariqnasheed uniform and did not have a badge on. Yeah, could you imagine why news was not interested in this story? HE IS WHITE|||||@Karey1975 @tariqnasheed he was disturbing the peace, physically fighting officer, and was armed with flashlight. I asked for example...|||||@Karey1975 @tariqnasheed ...of innocent, UNARMED person. You still have no examples|||||@ricky_raw Ok, we are done. You are just racist. Cause he was unarmed. @tariqnasheed|||||@ricky_raw @tariqnasheed People actually got paid to poop in the streets by our government and act stupid to pass a law on us.|||||@Karey1975 @tariqnasheed also when have unarmed white teens been shot by black cops when not committing a crime?|||||@Karey1975 @tariqnasheed   Please, White people riot over losing Soccer games. Look up Soccer Hooligans genius.|||||@AusarDjedi @tariqnasheed Are you saying soccer is popular in America? It isn't. other countries yes.|||||@Karey1975 @tariqnasheed   How about the "Olympic Beer Riots" in Salt Lake City in 2002  cuz there was no bar room: http://t.co/HcSLRnQ0bt|||||@Karey1975 @tariqnasheed   Seriously? We are telling about White people. They just don't exist in America you know.|||||@Karey1975 @tariqnasheed WTO had hippy whites tearing places up.|||||@Obsidian711 @tariqnasheed When? I most likely wasn't born yet. All I know about is Occupy &amp; they were paid by the government to act stupid.|||||@Karey1975 @tariqnasheed 1999 the WTO Protests in cities were causing minor looting.  Though the plight of Blacks will always be unique|||||@Karey1975 @tariqnasheed   At least when we riot is over important issues like like police brutality, poverty and racism.|||||@AusarDjedi Yeah, but every death is racism to you. I know it is because the Al Sharpton's of the world act like every one is but they r not|||||@Karey1975   First of all why do you act like Al Sharpton represents all of us?|||||@AusarDjedi There is two well known black leaders and they come from the same types. You need MLK types. God knows his mind was right.|||||@Karey1975   Second let's look at the deaths by police|||||@Karey1975   The real ones were killed off by FBI, U.S. Army, and other government agencies. Al Sharpton and Jessie are government puppets|||||@Karey1975   When you say "well known" your talking about ones allowed to be on White controlled media|||||@AusarDjedi @tariqnasheed Every single cop isn't racist. If they shoot, it is because they feel in danger 4 the most part. Not saying all r|||||@Karey1975 @AusarDjedi @tariqnasheed  they feel in Danger? LMAO|||||@VerifiedNiceGuy You do know over 90% if all African American deaths are done by other African Americans? @AusarDjedi @tariqnasheed|||||@Karey1975 @VerifiedNiceGuy @AusarDjedi @tariqnasheed and about 85% of white murders are by whites also. What's your point?|||||@ricky_raw My point is deal with where they come from. Instead of riots. @VerifiedNiceGuy @AusarDjedi @tariqnasheed|||||@ricky_raw I don't recall complaining about white deaths. @VerifiedNiceGuy @AusarDjedi @tariqnasheed|||||@Karey1975 The majority of all violent crime happens within a race/ethnicity.  Whites kill more whites, Asians kill more asians.|||||@Obsidian711 Well single digits get killed by cops; so, rioting the wrong place.|||||@Obsidian711 There is no way that teen was complying with the cops for that to happen.|||||@Karey1975 hypothetical. Let‚Äôs say he DID steal &amp; he DID run away. In the end of the day he would STILL be a man stealing virtually nothing|||||@VerifiedNiceGuy R u saying that the teen didn't do anything 2 be shot at? I have a hard time believing he complied w/ the Cop.@AusarDjedi|||||@Karey1975 @VerifiedNiceGuy   Why don't you check the eyewitness account at :55  http://t.co/u92bi5sVbP|||||@AusarDjedi @VerifiedNiceGuy More interested in the car camera.|||||@Karey1975 @VerifiedNiceGuy  Well, why haven't the police released it to quell the riot?|||||@Karey1975 @VerifiedNiceGuy  And as in the Oscar Grant case the shooting of unarmed Black youth on camera apparently doesn't matter|||||@AusarDjedi @VerifiedNiceGuy That teen did something to be shot at. Camera will tell.|||||@Karey1975 @VerifiedNiceGuy   Yep, those are the excuses that people like you give cuz you just can't believe in blatant racism|||||@AusarDjedi For someone willing to jump on the race wagon without all the facts, I believe wait for all sides of the story @VerifiedNiceGuy|||||@Karey1975 @VerifiedNiceGuy   Seriously? When you see enough of these stories you start seeing the patterns and see the narrative|||||@AusarDjedi @VerifiedNiceGuy Apparently, that is what you want to see. Get the facts before making conclusions.|||||@AusarDjedi @VerifiedNiceGuy I am done. I don't socialize with racist on either side of the spectrum.|||||@Karey1975 @VerifiedNiceGuy  You're done cuz you haven't had any your facts straight in our reactions|||||@Karey1975 @VerifiedNiceGuy   None of that was done here|||||@Karey1975 @VerifiedNiceGuy   And check what this witness tells the reporter:  http://t.co/PTVjFN9Ujz|||||@VerifiedNiceGuy All cars have cameras on them. The truth is out there. @AusarDjedi @tariqnasheed|||||@tariqnasheed Looting and setting fires at every black death is ignorance at its finest. No color of persons can behave like this in America

Just curious here.|||||@taylorb972 @PDPJ the gun is bigger than a pistol that's the point lol lets not be too politically correct for a general statement|||||@Temo4three @PDPJ Sorry but I'm a firearm owner and know a .223 cartridge isn't as powerful as people claim it is to be. .308 is different|||||@taylorb972 @PDPJ nah I'm with you, but an average joe sees rifle with a scope and are intimidated. I think the police know that|||||@Temo4three agreed. I did hear that Missouri State Militia has boots on the ground to defend citizens.|||||@taylorb972 hmm almost want to go get some pics/footage since it's so close|||||@Temo4three If I could get to Missouri I'd live feed the entire thing.|||||@taylorb972 tryna charge my phone now for it|||||@Temo4three if you do shoot me a link.|||||@taylorb972 I'll try to set up a ustream|||||@Temo4three @taylorb972 @PDPJ Considerng that such rifles have killed tens of thousands of lives, bellyaching about caliber is ludicrous.|||||@Meteor_Blades @taylorb972 we understand the caliber if the situation. No pun intended.|||||@taylorb972 @Temo4three @PDPJ .223 will still kill you at 500 yards. Likely chambered in 5.56 mm, that's what the military uses.|||||@brunota2003 @Temo4three @PDPJ .223 &amp; 5.56 are the same. Also if it was effective troops overseas wouldn't complain about it.|||||@taylorb972 @Temo4three @PDPJ I know they are the same. We were taught to shoot to 300 meters, Marines shoot to 500. Stopping power isn't...|||||@taylorb972 @Temo4three @PDPJ great, but it will still kill you. Protesters nowhere near 300 meters out and no body armor.|||||@brunota2003 @taylorb972 @PDPJ probably just rubber pellets though|||||@Temo4three @brunota2003 @PDPJ they do have rubber bullet rounds for rifles so you might be right.|||||@Temo4three @taylorb972 @PDPJ do they make rubber bullets for .223?

You're seriously arguing that .223s won't kill people despite a half-century of doing just that? ye gods.|||||@Meteor_Blades that was a discussion LAST NIGHT. Keep up or dont throw in your two cents. Also the rifle was loaded with rubber bullets....|||||@taylorb972 @brunota2003 @Temo4three @PDPJ kindalight but for a crowd m14 308 standard clip on a bipod low power scope for wide field view|||||@taylorb972 Haha just read some other replies.

Unarmed protestors! How do some people not see this as an injustice?|||||@Bakari45 @PDPJ uh, maybe because people are rioting and trying to solve violence with violence.|||||@SimplyKirk_ @PDPJ, how is being unarmed and protesting a act of violence?|||||@Bakari45 @PDPJ people aren't unarmed and people aren't just protesting.|||||@SimplyKirk_ , right! Who has shot at who? The cops are pointing guns at unarmed ppl.|||||@Bakari45 if the people wouldn't of pulled guns and rioted then the cops wouldn't be aiming back.|||||@SimplyKirk_, right! If cops can kill an unarmed man, armed ppl would have been shot immediately.|||||@Bakari45 btw in the news articles it says he pulled a gun on the police and that's why they shot him. Also, he didn't die.|||||@SimplyKirk_, right! Four witnesses have testified that he didn‚Äôt have a gun.|||||@SimplyKirk_, If he had a gun, the cops would have reported it by now. They‚Äôre being silent, because they‚Äôre covering up a murder.|||||@SimplyKirk_,who didn‚Äôt die? #MichaelBrown was murdered!|||||@Bakari45 sorry wrong guy. I meant the guy with the gun. Had my names mixed up.|||||@SimplyKirk_, stop excusing the police attacks on unarmed people. It‚Äôs not right, and it should be illegal.|||||@Bakari45 @PDPJ everyone rioting is being extremely selfish and overshadowing the real issue which was the boy being killed.|||||@SimplyKirk_, not everyone is rioting. #Michealbrown wasn‚Äôt rioting when he was murdered. Ppl have a right to protest.|||||@Bakari45 well at least you're acknowledging people are rioting.|||||@SimplyKirk_, and you still haven‚Äôt acknowledged that it‚Äôs unjust to shoot and kill unarmed ppl. Because this is what it‚Äôs about.|||||@SimplyKirk_, unarmed ppl were/are pissed off because their community has been militarized, and they are being terrorized.|||||@Bakari45 @PDPJ if the kid was trying to fight the cop he could have grabbed the officers gun. Everyone should wait for facts.|||||@ReidGolson10, Several witnesses say #Michealbrown raised his hands, and said don‚Äôt shoot.|||||@Bakari45 those witnesses could be lying? The cop could be lying. Just saying, there is always two stories. I don't jump to conclusions.|||||@ReidGolson10, and yeah, the cops started spinning their story right after #Michealbrown was shot.|||||@Bakari45 they may have or may have not. We don't know the facts of the situation. It's all hear say by cops and witnesses. Sad, nonetheless|||||@ReidGolson10, cops need to learn how to talk to people, and stop abusing their power. The kid was unarmed. Fact!|||||@Bakari45 I agree, some cops are very power hungry. There are cops across America giving the rest of the police officers a bad image.|||||@ReidGolson10, exactly. Search how many UNARMED Black people have been killed by cops.|||||@Bakari45 with that being said though there is always a gun in a fight with an officer. So I just want to hear all facts of the situation.|||||@ReidGolson10, plenty of cases of unarmed Black men killed by cops. No other gun involved.|||||@ReidGolson10, http://t.co/fLSAO31eRm Beyond Trayvon: Black and Unarmed|||||@Bakari45 a lot of those cases aren't recent, but this shouldn't be about race. This should be about getting corrupt cops off the streets.|||||@Bakari45 get the bad ones off the streets and there will be less incidents towards African Americans.. In my opinion.|||||@ReidGolson10, how is walking home from the store being ‚Äúbad‚Äù? Re: #Michealbrown #TrayvonMartin|||||@Bakari45 you misunderstood. Get the bad cops off the streets that target solely African Americans.|||||@ReidGolson10, the entire criminal ‚Äújustice‚Äù system is corrupt. Read the book, The New Jim Crow, by Michelle Alexandar.|||||@ReidGolson10, this country has always been plagued by racism, economic exploitation, inequality, and corruption.|||||@ReidGolson10, In other words, you‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúIf only Black people would just do as they are told.‚Äù Typical.|||||@Bakari45 I never once said or implied that? I said the police officers that target harmless minorities should be taken off the streets.|||||@ReidGolson10, okay. Gotcha. Sorry for misreading it. It happens in social media.|||||@Bakari45 lol no problem. Definitely wasn't talking about that. I enjoy a good civil discussion.|||||@ReidGolson10, cops are being militarized across the country.|||||@ReidGolson10, you do realize that the community of #Fergsuon has been militarized against unarmed ppl?|||||@Bakari45 yea it's not a good thing. They should just let them protest. I don't agree with all the looting though.|||||@ReidGolson10, right. Property is more important than ppl? What you‚Äôre seeing is Black rage. Ppl are tired of the injustices.|||||@ReidGolson10, looting is the least of the problem. Killing unarmed people is the problem.|||||@ReidGolson10, when was the last time a cop drove through your community and told you to get the ‚Äúfuck‚Äù off the street?|||||@Bakari45 cops handle situations differently everywhere because it gets to the people they are dealing with. I wouldn't be offended by that.|||||@ReidGolson10, yeah right. I doubt it will ever happen in your community. If so, you‚Äôd be outraged.|||||@ReidGolson10, how many unarmed Black people have been shot and killed in the last year alone?

739	3	Whenever you want to justify shooting an unarmed person you always say they reached for your gun.

Not my intention to make anyone think that.|||||@CrystalSaidThat Thank you for clarifying. We all need to stand together and let the investigation unfold. And condemn rioting and looting.|||||@TheBHolland we've got to start with the atrocities of killing black men first. There has never been rioting were real peace lived first.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland 94% of all blacks killed are killed by other blacks. Where are the protests for that? http://t.co/LSHj5Zz2Wz|||||@qb_ramirez I agree completely! But we also need a full investigation of what happened in #Ferguson. @CrystalSaidThat|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat No doubt. No one wants renegade cops shooting w/out cause. Facts need to come out 1st before we indict anyone.|||||@TheBHolland @qb_ramirez exactly. I hate when the focus is taken off of the issue to talk about black on black crime. Smh.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland The issue is 'self defense' or 'murder'? Just like Trayvon. Not race. Media &amp; race hustlers change focus.|||||@qb_ramirez @TheBHolland and 85% of whites kill whites, but white men are not under seige. Ask blacks who commit crimes, not me!|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland Blacks are under siege by who? Cops have to police areas of ppl that r taught to hate cops. (Cont'd)|||||@CrystalSaidThat I understand, but let's be honest there is a moral crisis in black America. 70+ % out of wedlock birthdate! @qb_ramirez|||||@TheBHolland @qb_ramirez @CrystalSaidThat not to mentional vast majority of felons in prison are of a certain race. morals are a big issue.|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez every race in AMERICA has moral issues! It's not just a problem of Black morals.|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat I agree. It all starts w/ breakdown of family, which leads to bad morals, NO MATTER WHAT RACE.|||||@qb_ramirez @psherm07 @TheBHolland exacly! When your history shows that you weren't able to be married or be considered human, its passed on|||||@CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland oh you think blacks arent able to get married or considered human? stupid tweet of the day award!|||||@psherm07 @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland dont name call! I was giving you an insight to what some talk about when it gets down to the history.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland YOU are responsible for your choices. not someone else. OWN IT. no one holds you back, stops u.|||||@psherm07 @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland I AM NOT THE ISSUE! We were talking about the entirety.  DON'T make it personal. Damn, we cant even share|||||@CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland Im not making anything personal. that is general comments aimed at the issue.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland reason nothing changes is 2 many people r 2 busy claiming victim status instead of working hard.|||||@CrystalSaidThat So you don't think the welfare state plays a role in this, or personal responsibility? @qb_ramirez @psherm07|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez no she thinks America is racist and its all America's fault, her community has no responsibility.|||||@psherm07 That's unfortunate. @CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez|||||@TheBHolland @qb_ramirez @psherm07 It ALLLLLL plays a part. There is always a starting point, the history of a problem.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez MANY people face all kinds of problems and succeed. no excuses. its up to you to succeed. own it.|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez and all races suffer on some level. It's  not always the BLACKS. There are high % for other races too.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @psherm07 @TheBHolland Just tired of race hustlers in Media &amp; Govt' that Booker T warned us about: http://t.co/ddtSztpFwH|||||@CrystalSaidThat No doubt, but blaming others &amp; not taking personal responsibility has multiplied problems for blacks. @psherm07 @qb_ramirez|||||@TheBHolland @psherm07 @qb_ramirez that there is a HUGE other problem! Trust me, I spend countless hours mentoring about that!|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez need more leaders that stress gd choices, not ones who promote strife and victimhood.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @psherm07 Good for u for mentoring. Crystal u obviously made wise choices in life. That's all we're saying.|||||@CrystalSaidThat We're all sinners, and we all need to repent and take responsibility for our own actions. @qb_ramirez @psherm07|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @psherm07 BOOM! That says it all. You are right.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez There are plenty of chances to succeed, just look at college aid, affirm action. work hard, own it|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @psherm07 Everyone's been crapped on. Look at the Jews. Dwelling on the past has never been good advice|||||@qb_ramirez Amen! @CrystalSaidThat @psherm07|||||@qb_ramirez @CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland continuing to choose to be a victim isnt the recipe for success. rolling up sleeves and working is|||||@psherm07 Life is hard for everyone. @qb_ramirez @CrystalSaidThat|||||@psherm07 @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland ALL RACES need that advice; but understand, we all don't have the same history. Period.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland ask irish about their history when they got here. tell me they had it gd. or jews. stop being vics|||||@CrystalSaidThat And we will have to stand before God one day to give account of our lives. We can't blame others. @psherm07 @qb_ramirez|||||@TheBHolland @psherm07 @qb_ramirez EVERYBODY will have to atone for the part they play. EVERYONE.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland start rebuilding fams, teaching morals, find God, pursue education, teach hard work pays.|||||@psherm07 Well said! Those are eternal principles upon which we can all build our lives upon! @CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez|||||@psherm07 @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland I mentor about that EVERYDAY! Getting in the neighborhoods to get women off of the system.  It's tough!|||||@CrystalSaidThat We have to teach people to not become dependent on big government. And not vote for it, because it's @psherm07 @qb_ramirez|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez when a life of crime is more appealing than work and school, we have a problem.|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez when killing someone for sneakers or drugs is acceptable, we have a problem.|||||@TheBHolland @psherm07 @qb_ramirez ABSOLUTELY! There is a difference between living off of the government and CARING for the REAL POOR.|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez when babies are mealtickets, we have a problem. when men father and abandon fams we have a problem|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez family values, 10 commandments, morals/ethics need restoration. its the bedrock. education too.|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez but just like all sin, there is a ROOT.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez root doesnt matter one bit. every single person has the choice to turn from sin regardless of root|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez i disagree, because the Bible would have left out Eve biting the apple instead of always referencing it.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez thanks for great convo, all, i appreciate the honest discourse and very civil tone have a gr8 day!|||||@CrystalSaidThat it's toxic. Big govenment is at the root of the problem. @psherm07 @qb_ramirez|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @psherm07 AMEN. It is what takes the place of fathers and husbands in broken communities.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland or continue on the path your community is on &amp; see the bad continue. its your community's choice.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @psherm07 @TheBHolland We escaped a Communist country where our land was stolen/friends imprisoned &amp; never looked back.|||||@qb_ramirez @CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland ..and came to America and made a life and worked hard and succeeded. tools r there make gd choices|||||@CrystalSaidThat @psherm07 @TheBHolland Why dwell on the past? We live in the freest country in the world.SUCCESS is always the best revenge|||||@qb_ramirez Most people of all races only want blacks to succeed and thrive! @CrystalSaidThat @psherm07|||||@TheBHolland @qb_ramirez @CrystalSaidThat i want a healthy, happy, strong, moral America, regardless of what race, creed or color you are.|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat This is the conversation on responsible choices that too many on the Left do not want us to have.|||||@qb_ramirez @TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat not only dont want to have, but openly try to silence and stop dead in its tracks.|||||@qb_ramirez @psherm07 @TheBHolland Lol! I just said that yesterday! Those on the system make politicians RICH!!!|||||@CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez @TheBHolland some 'community leadership' is the reason the problems remain, they profit from it &amp; perpetuate it|||||@CrystalSaidThat I want you check out this documentary http://t.co/WiBVlgXgB9 Please and Thanks! @qb_ramirez @psherm07|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @psherm07 My wife is yelling at me for still tweeting but had to check out trailer.

Our membership has it's perks!|||||@CrystalSaidThat And marriage is the best anti-poverty program there is! @qb_ramirez @psherm07|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez behind every successful family is a proud, strong supportive hard working wife.|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez LOL! My husband better get that tattooed TODAY! He's a truck driver and a carpenter, so it wont hurt!|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez =)|||||@CrystalSaidThat A hard working man! @psherm07 @qb_ramirez|||||@qb_ramirez Tell her you're helping to save the County, and we appreciate all of your hard work! @CrystalSaidThat @psherm07|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat Great debate. Love when we can all share our differing ideas free of insults. God Bless. Gotta run.|||||@qb_ramirez Me too! Much love and repect to all who participated in this conversation. @psherm07 @CrystalSaidThat|||||@TheBHolland @qb_ramirez @psherm07 but Blacks are not the highest % of welfare recipients.|||||@CrystalSaidThat I know, but they are way overrepresented. @qb_ramirez @psherm07|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez a close personal friend went from losing a job and everything, to being homeless.|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez those are the ones that need help from the system! Folks that worked and fell on hard times!|||||@TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez he didnt give up. worked three jobs, living @ shelter, got college degree. live right, work hard.|||||@TheBHolland @qb_ramirez @psherm07 because our population is smaller. Yep! You're right.|||||@CrystalSaidThat Blacks ARE victims of big government, leftist, progressive ideas and policies! @qb_ramirez @psherm07|||||@CrystalSaidThat It all comes back to slavery? @qb_ramirez @psherm07|||||@CrystalSaidThat @psherm07 @TheBHolland Welfare dependancy has more to do w/ it. Before 1964 blacks marriage rate was higher than whites.|||||@psherm07 @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez look at the stats for certain crimes.  Federal prison is overwhelmingly white for white collar crimes.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez thats not relevant. majority of all Felony Inmates are one race. their community is in crisis.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez Juan is right. it stems from breakdown of families and values, leading to amorality.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez and THAT has nothing to do with race. Has EVERYTHING to do with families and values.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland @qb_ramirez these facts r unpleasant, but facts none less. Build stronger fams based on moral values is answer|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland Crimes go unsolved cuz folks r taught that 'snitches get stitches' &amp; that cops hate u. Vicious cycle. (Cont'd)|||||@qb_ramirez @TheBHolland that's in EVERY community! Black America gets so irritated because we're ALWAYS lumped together like we're not shit|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland Come on Crystal, u know 'stop snitching' is a big problem in the black community: http://t.co/Mcu1RBMGGR|||||@qb_ramirez @TheBHolland I hear that phrase in my white neighborhood. It's not just a BLACK issue. They do it on Capital Hill TOO!|||||@CrystalSaidThat My wife is black, and we have 2 kids together. I only want the best for everybody, but if we can't agree that..@qb_ramirez|||||@TheBHolland @qb_ramirez my husband and I have 3 grown sons, college educated. Their experiences make me cry. Being a black mother is hard!|||||@CrystalSaidThat agree that there is an absolute crisis of morality in the black community, and has been so for several decades @qb_ramirez|||||@CrystalSaidThat then I don't think this conversation can go any further. @qb_ramirez|||||@qb_ramirez @TheBHolland @CrystalSaidThat What would the country look like without the Police. Be glad you have them.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @qb_ramirez We have to be honest about that breakdown, or else we get nowhere!|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland No doubt there r bad cops. I've met some. But most r risking their lives, 4 little pay in hostile neighbohoods|||||@CrystalSaidThat @TheBHolland &amp; I just can't stand the race hustlers like Al, Black Panthers &amp; Jesse always dividing the country. Sick of it|||||@qb_ramirez @TheBHolland no prejudice and hate divides the country, but those are the foundations that this country was built on.|||||@CrystalSaidThat If there were more intact homes, then there would be less of need for a police presence.|||||@TheBHolland but that is for EVERY RACE IN AMERICA, not just blacks.|||||@CrystalSaidThat I'm not justifying cops who go overboard however.|||||@CrystalSaidThat They are, and most people are saddened and troubled by that. And most blacks are killed by other blacks. @rolandsmartin|||||@TheBHolland @rolandsmartin Absolutely,  but this is not the case of #MichaelBrown. The focus needs to be on a dead, unarmed black man.|||||@CrystalSaidThat @rolandsmartin sounds like you think he robbed that store...the shoes are different sandals in robbery pics sneakers on MB?|||||@gig_42 @rolandsmartin just really sad how the tables are trying to be turned, but the truth is not transparent. There's something deeper.|||||@rolandsmartin Yes it does.  Which is why most reasonable people have advocated waiting for ALL facts before jumping to conclusions.|||||@rolandsmartin Good point!|||||@rolandsmartin They will have to soon, will they not? I would imagine it will be released with the County Police Commissioners report.|||||@rolandsmartin trajectory, number of injuries, entrance points|||||@rolandsmartin yes this police chief is pitiful.|||||@rolandsmartin when will an arrest take place? #Ferguson|||||@rolandsmartin it's shocking how ur stirring things up b4 facts come out, one would think you've learned that lesson- sad story though|||||@krisdalzell4 not stirring up Jack.|||||@rolandsmartin Roland, you're not giving 2 sides- ur a reporter right?

You okay with that too?|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense Ceases to be a peaceful demonstration when looting and committing arson. Stay in your home, you don't get gassed.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Read the goddam coverage. PEOPLE GOT GASSED IN THEIR HOMES. Read something besides the headlines.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Plenty of reputable reporters on the ground saying the cops were out of control, even local Fox affiliate|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense and regardless, you think, as a libertarian, it's cool small town cops are tooled up like that?|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense I have *some* police training as I was going into Law Enforcement at one point. I know why they were geared up.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Yeah, and i have cops in the family , and military, and all of them are "What the FUCK?"|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Screaming "Bring it you fucking animals!!" at the crowd, and tear-gassing people in their own yards|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense that's not policing.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense http://t.co/RI0oog5bKN  this is what I'm seeing in the news|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Again, not even addressing people tear-gassed in their own yards.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Good cops de-escalate. These guys ramped it up.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense This look like good policing to you? http://t.co/j9A3buJOyD|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Confirmed multiple sources, Fox news, LAT, washington post.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense  http://t.co/sCVGDC5Fzf|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense But you keep kind of skipping over the "tear-gassing people in their own yards"|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense Well the demonstrators were picking up the canisters and throwing them back, and people should have stayed inside.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Yeah, I think marcvhing into a neighborhood, kitted out, screaming at people, tear-gassing even the unarmed ...|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense They were dispersing a riot, if you are in the mob you are just as guilty. BTW there were armed pple mixed in the riot|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Again, ignoring the people who were trying to get to the homes they were ordered to go to.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense Shouldn't have participated in the mob mentality. I know based on common sense that I'm likely to get gassed in a mob|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense When does a demonstration turn into a mob? and any questions at all about a weird shooting is "conspiracy theory?|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense Questions is fine once the area is calmed but not during a riot, public safety limiting casualties.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Annnd having the press around is one way to prevent police brutality. I'll take the trade-off.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Because it's not like there was no risk of THAT in this situation.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Look, we have fundamentally different relationships with authority. Let's part pleasantly.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense been pleasant this whole time.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense that's what I meant, thanks. take care.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense kind of weird how not allowing press to see what you're doing, after a dubious shooting, inflames people. True|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense Weird, trying to keep people/press out so no more get hurt, is a "cover up" sounds like  Alex Jones conspiracy theory|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Dude, not going to agree. Farewell.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense the question is always "reasonable and appropriate force". And the cops are ESCALATING that situation.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense So to fix this "escalation" since cops are to blame, set a perimeter, let them burn their own neighborhood down. Solved|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense ... yeah, I consider that "escalation", to use your sarcasm quotes.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense But if the police ONLY did what you want, set up a perimeter and stay out, you're right, it would have been cool.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense that's what I mean by "de-escalation" and some of the better trained St. Louis cops on the scene are doing so.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense They have set a perimeter and not allow people/reporters in and are getting crucified for that too. No pleasing ppl.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense But hey, we're not going to convince each other.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Be cool, and go our separate ways.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense No problem with cops being properly equipped. "reasonably" But handing out military grade hardware ...|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense according to antigunners more than an old west 6shooter is considered military grade it seems. Even a semi auto pistol.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Not denying there's some looting. Always some assholes whenever trouble starts.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Hell of a lIbertarian.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense  I'm a Libertarian but I also can see a non peaceful demonstration. Burning your neighborhood down doesn't solve shit.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense Nobody "burned down the neighborhood".|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense Its like Miami in the 80's, LA in the 90's burn/loot your neighborhood then bitch when there aren't jobs anymore.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense the fact that what you;re saying has no relationship to what happened, as reported, doesn't matter to you|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense rioting, out of control people fits your narrative.    This is why I'm not a Libertarian anymore.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense most of my family are LEO and Military too man, they aren't WTF with the cops but at the people burning/looting.|||||@Libertarian82 @BI_Defense "4 or 5" guys on the loot, a couple hundred peaceful protesters, that's what you get out of that.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense Rioting, looting, burning unrelated business' should be met with whatever force necessary, else illegal acts continue.|||||@trucker_63601 @BI_Defense How about peaceful demonstrations? How about people tear-gassed in their own yards? How about policing?|||||@trucker_63601 @BI_Defense Enjoy your police state.|||||@jonrog1 @BI_Defense scary and Americans need to wake up.

823	3	Quiet where I am. Lots of talking. Lots of standing. No smash-smash. #Ferguson http://t.co/dXiIc5EQqq|||||One of the stranger elements of covering all this is seeing major demonstrations expressed in a suburban context.|||||In cities you rally in parks, in squares. Tahrir. Maidan. Zucotti. Here, we're standing in the street, outside a QuikTrip.|||||And I realize that's partly because the street has become a square. Because the police have partially boxed it in.|||||We don't really have pedestrian squares in the US, only a l'il in NYC @mattdpearce|||||Would we be here if the police weren't here? Or is the QuikTrip a de facto park because it's burned down, and no longer corporate space.|||||Well, here we are, and nobody's kicking us out, exactly. So. Suburban public space.|||||^^ Interesting train of thought on public space and protest by @mattdpearce|||||Now everybody's a bit wired up because a woman almost tried to drive through the police line. http://t.co/bW8pYzmnZO|||||Cops shouted at her. The men in the street told her to turn around, and then drifted toward the cops. Lots of jawing now.|||||@mattdpearce You'll find historical perspective in this book from @MikeKellyColumn. A similar case in Teaneck, 1991: http://t.co/OdcuPuBDc1|||||@mattdpearce How do you collect petition signatures in the suburbs? Not so easy either, as learned in MO-wide initiative on payday loans.|||||...and that's how .@mattdpearce's excellent coverage of race in America today through the lens of #Ferguson lead to commentary on urbanism.|||||Remember all that stuff I was tweeting about suburban public space?

You've helped immensely.|||||Suburban Tahrir.|||||Self-regulated, self-organized ‚Äî we're basically talking about an anarchist space.|||||Those spaces are usually really fun and sometimes euphoric but can run into problems when entropy sets in.|||||But like, these people are going to remember this night for the rest of their lives.

I know you want the name of the cop who nabbed you, but is Johnson's response good?|||||@ryanjreilly @paigelav his fucking response is exactly why police officers are required by law to wear their badges:  responsibility.|||||@ryanjreilly Thanks for this. The law says they must, no? If so, who *does* have the authority to police the police on this point?|||||@ryanjreilly @paigelav so was it Ferguson PD or County PD?

979	3	It's messed up when cops can shoot unarmed Black teen yet White people can walk around Target with AR-15's! #Ferguson|||||@bannerite if the residents at #Ferguson incident were armed with AR-15s, the situation would have gone different. This is why 2nd Amd exist|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite If the residents of Ferguson had AR-15s, the media would have labelled them cop killers.|||||@BWorthingtonIII @bannerite no one said shoot the cops. Similar to the Bundy Ranch situation, the cowards would have backed down. #furguson|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite They brought riot gear and riot trucks. They WANTED there to be an altercation.|||||@BWorthingtonIII @bannerite let's say the police started shooting first in this hypothetical situation? Media will still cover it up?|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite So far media coverage has only focused on the crowd's reaction. Only Twitter has focused on the actual shooting...|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite If they shot an UNARMED Black youth, what do you think they would have done to ARMED Black MEN?|||||@BWorthingtonIII @bannerite So what are black communities supposed to do in these situations? Sit back and be terrorized?|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite No. I believe we do need to arm ourselves. I agree with your premise, just not that it would have prevented THIS..|||||@BWorthingtonIII @bannerite you make good points. Can't really do much against an MRAP used in war overseas...|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite The only real solution is we need to police our own. They can't do it. Too many of them fear ALL of us...|||||@BWorthingtonIII @bannerite has any of the local media confirm he was unarmed? Assuming you are near there that is.|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite I'm not. But all of the reports from the ground confirm that he was unarmed...No weapons were recovered...|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite We need WHITE police OUT of our neighborhoods.THEY can't protect US.We're more likely to need protection FROM them|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite Wrong wrong WRONG wrrrrong, you are a dumb ass, and in addition, the 2nd Amendment doesn't say that.|||||@ZombozzieWins @bannerite You are out of your mind. That is a recipe for a total disaster.|||||@NoWayNRA1 @bannerite so no guns for citizens but MRAPs, dogs, helicopters and yes, guns for cops who do this shit? Look who sounds insane.|||||#whitepeoplelogic MT @ZombozzieWins: if residents at #Ferguson were armed w/AR-15s situation would've gone different. why 2nd Amd exist|||||@_nowimgold forgetting history are we?|||||@_nowimgold @ZombozzieWins Right.... and this is why we need mental healthcare in this country.|||||@_nowimgold @ZombozzieWins Nothing says freedom like armed whacks who have never given a day in service to USA thinking they can be leaders|||||@TwinmomSue @_nowimgold never said I was armed.

Clear enough?|||||@TwinmomSue you may lose that bet. Don't assume shit you don't know. Someone can support the 2nd without being an armed "gun nut"|||||@ZombozzieWins I  supp ALL the amendments.

That's the problem. #MichaelBrown #Ferguson|||||@piersmorgan  hoe suck mah dick-|||||@piersmorgan Stop talking shit|||||@piersmorgan where are the right wingers screaming about 2nd amendment rights now?|||||.@saramaria616 Where's the 2nd Amendment implication here?|||||@OhioCoastie just a general statement about the entire Michael Brown tragedy.|||||@saramaria616 Plenty of us have been "screaming" about it, as you put it.|||||@saramaria616 Stuff like this: https://t.co/0rJw1u2Z6q|||||@saramaria616 @piersmorgan Sara you poor misguided misinformed soul. 70% of the US supports 2nd Am. Only Liberal nut jobs don't.|||||@Sports_Politic @piersmorgan I must be a proud liberal nut then, eh?|||||@saramaria616 @piersmorgan yea there is a cure - get off the kool aid and educate yrself with unbiased sources.|||||@Sports_Politic @piersmorgan I'm plenty educated, thanks. I prefer, like the majority of the westernized world, strict gun control|||||@saramaria616 @piersmorgan yea your tweet sounded educated. From the Rachel Maddow School. Move to France they have everything u love.|||||@Sports_Politic @piersmorgan Thank you! That is quite the compliment. @maddow is an inspiration to me.|||||@saramaria616 @piersmorgan by the way and "educated" person wouldn't say only right wingers support gun control. A Liberal fool would.|||||@Sports_Politic Go Sox!|||||@saramaria616 Quick question: You own a fire extinguisher because firefighters aren't instant. Why do you think people own guns?|||||@Beaker0304 @saramaria616 why is that hypothetical only relevant in the USA?|||||@alagich3 @saramaria616 Not sure I understand your question. I would consider it relevant with any society.|||||@Beaker0304 @saramaria616 if the real reason why you think Americans own guns is self defense I think you are mistaken.|||||@alagich3 @saramaria616 I don't believe in applying such a broad brush to a group of 350 mil ppl. Those I know of, own for that reason.|||||@Beaker0304 @saramaria616 fair point. would those ppl also have invested in home security? Actual self defense? Or is a gun the easy option|||||@alagich3 @saramaria616 I can't speak for others, but I would want a gun for home protection. Home security just calls police. (Wait 5-10)|||||@Beaker0304 @saramaria616 so if you're woken up by a knife to the throat, how useful is your gun? "Bad guys" will be deterred by an alarm|||||@alagich3 @saramaria616 Touch√©. It is situational. I guess the best thing is to do all of them to cover more possible situations.|||||@Beaker0304 that's exactly my point! Seems to me just arming yourself is too convenient for people who care so much about self defense|||||@alagich3 It's not that I care so much about it. I just don't want to be a victim. And I suppose it is more convenient, but why not?|||||@Beaker0304 because if I was invading your house,I'd probably not want to let you know I was, right?So a gun is redundant of you are unaware|||||@alagich3 True. I was robbed at my old apartment at 2am. I slept through it. But, if they had went further in, I may have heard. At least...|||||@alagich3 ...then I'm armed if I wake up, as opposed to unarmed and terrified.|||||@alagich3 Idk. There are definitely other options if guns aren't your cup o tea, I just want the right to be able to own one myself....|||||@alagich3 I respect their destructive power by being cautious and responsible. They're not toys, but they are also not indiscriminately evil|||||@Beaker0304 100%|||||@alagich3 100% of what?|||||@Beaker0304 ha no I mean I agree 100%. You don't seem like the typical brainwashed gun nut that piers Morgan usually attracts on twitter|||||@alagich3 Thank you for that. I don't like when anyone, regardless of their 'side' on a debate, resorts to name calling or fallacies.|||||@alagich3 I appreciate someone who disagrees with me by challenging my reasoning, instead of assuming I'm in a certain 'crazy' camp.|||||@alagich3 @saramaria616 And if the person or people robbing you could physically over power you, training isn't foolproof.|||||@Beaker0304 don't bother with training because they might be able to overpower you? Just get a gun as the easy alternative?|||||@alagich3 I don't feel inclined to concern myself with the safety of home invaders.|||||@Beaker0304 you're missing the point, would you keep 'invading' a home where an alarm is sounding and police have likely been called?|||||@alagich3 Why? I don't know the mindset of someone that does it in the first place. The initial decision is illogical to me.|||||@Beaker0304 only arming yourself for the potential threat of a home invader is too convenient. Why not stop them from getting inside first?|||||@alagich3 A big ass wall is a lot more expensive. :)|||||@saramaria616 @piersmorgan libs are the ones who want only police to have guns remember?|||||@piersmorgan I don't have one. So that statement is inaccurate.|||||@AureliaFierros @piersmorgan no it isn't. He clearly says "usually"|||||@DirkBronco @piersmorgan Then define "usually" because that is an ambiguous and inaccurate term itself.|||||@AureliaFierros @piersmorgan most of the time. You think he is wrong then? Crazy crazy country and people|||||@DirkBronco @piersmorgan Yes, he is.|||||@AureliaFierros @piersmorgan fair enough, can you explain why this happens in the states so regularly then|||||@AureliaFierros @piersmorgan lots of people + lots of guns = lots of dead people|||||@AureliaFierros @piersmorgan do you know the definition of 'usually'? Hint: it doesn't mean always|||||@alagich3 @piersmorgan Ask Piers.|||||@alagich3 @piersmorgan If you think he's always right just because he has the mic, ten you're wrong too.|||||@AureliaFierros @piersmorgan not sure how you got to that conclusion.

1022	3	In the USA, if a cop says something, it automatically becomes fact. By law media must report it as fact no matter how outrageous. #Ferguson|||||@occbaystreet @youranonnews Can you cite this statute?|||||@davidrstites 1st Amendment. If you don't agree to that interpretation of 1st Amendment, you don't count as press.|||||@davidrstites @occbaystreet @YourAnonNews I hope that's sarcastic, but we do have lots of asinine laws!|||||@occbaystreet @YourAnonNews Oh, that's why the FBI were called in, because you know, if a cop says something, it's fact. Right...|||||@occbaystreet @YourAnonNews #PoliceStateFanatics #TheWorldHasOtherProblems #America|||||@occbaystreet @YourAnonNews yo! Anonymous before you attack facts, realize you misidentified the officer, facts go both ways, you're a mess.|||||@CatlinMichael immediately corrected by multiple major anon accounts. No one complaining about account suspension.|||||@occbaystreet you realize how dangerous and out of control realizing that name was tho, like the opposite of what is right &amp; just.|||||@CatlinMichael it was wrong. Much much less worse than what cops did to Mike Brown and the whole city.|||||@occbaystreet I agree it's WAY worse killing an unarmed teen but you lose all credibility when you do shit like realize the wrong name.|||||@CatlinMichael no, not all. Though that particular Anon has little and had little.|||||@occbaystreet so you don't lose credibility when you report incorrect facts? We'll stop there then.|||||@CatlinMichael @occbaystreet you're basically saying if 1 media outlet reports something then every media outlet is responsible #juststop|||||@bhaegle10 @occbaystreet no what I am saying is, anon shouldn't have released the name if they didn't know for sure that it was him.|||||@CatlinMichael @occbaystreet which tells me you don't understand what anonymous is, so again #juststop|||||@CatlinMichael @bhaegle10 anon is a collection of individuals. That anon has been denounced thoroughly, unlike way your cops circle wagons.|||||@CatlinMichael @occbaystreet just because 1 person of anon. says something doesn't mean they all agree. If you read some...|||||@CatlinMichael @occbaystreet you would've seen they all told that specific anon. member it was a terrible idea to release that name|||||@bhaegle10 @occbaystreet and now you are attacking me for saying the same thing? It was a terrible idea. That's what I said.|||||@CatlinMichael @occbaystreet you're saying 1 anon member = all of them. They're all individuals. It's not a hard concept to grasp|||||@CatlinMichael @bhaegle10 nah, you came at me for criticizing media swallowing horse shit cop story.|||||@CatlinMichael @occbaystreet read this and stop being such an egg http://t.co/WCKJgS0VoS|||||@bhaegle10 @occbaystreet I read it, thanks for the link. Still disagree with the tactic &amp; support the overall mission. It's okay to disagree|||||@CatlinMichael no one said that. But keep regurgitating the shit you swallow.|||||@occbaystreet @CatlinMichael and at least anon is trying to make a difference to find truth rather than sitting idle and watching it happen.|||||@hespelerpunk @occbaystreet but it's things like releasing the wrong name that make it easy for people to write them off. it was a bad idea.|||||@CatlinMichael @hespelerpunk everyone already admitted as much. Also, that whole hive held off for 4 days before that is amazing.|||||@occbaystreet @hespelerpunk i don't disagree, 2 wrongs don't make a right. They should have release the name soon, &amp; anon should have facts.|||||@occbaystreet @hespelerpunk we're all on the same side here, just maybe disagree about approach and tactics, I want the truth, not guesses|||||@CatlinMichael @occbaystreet you don't think police/government has never done that? They lie and give false info every fucking day.|||||@hespelerpunk @occbaystreet which is exactly why things like anon exist, who will fact check anon?|||||@CatlinMichael @hespelerpunk everyone. It was reversed w/in an hour and a half. By that way, that cop shot someone else, most likely.|||||@hespelerpunk @occbaystreet you can't be the truth seekers when you report false information, period.|||||@CatlinMichael @occbaystreet this is true. But who released that info specifically. Because anon is more of a collective than an "agency".|||||@CatlinMichael @occbaystreet could have been anyone?|||||@CatlinMichael @hespelerpunk bullshit. Everyone makes mistakes. It's how you handle em.|||||@occbaystreet this is also true. Regardless, anon is exposing this shit and it's amazing.

And you can't welcome me to America from Finland dear.|||||@TyrellMayfield @JeffersonObama The more militarized police get ...|||||@TyrellMayfield @fuzethemc insane logic isn't it?|||||@TyrellMayfield are you serious? The police have been shot at every night since Mike Brown was shot.|||||@SOrtbals I am serious. Those Policemen sitting atop an armored car are not worried about being shot.|||||@TyrellMayfield so, what should they wear? It's a paramilitary organization. Sorry it's not all warm and fuzzy.|||||@SOrtbals in America police depts  are not paramilitary organizations; They're community servants. Your mentality is part of the problem.|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals  ok buy if have thousands of angry people rioting, shooting, and stealing what are you suppose to do?|||||@CallMeLean @SOrtbals 1) it didn't start w/angry rioters 2) the response to violence largely contributes to its escalation or remission.|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals honestly this shit started cause he stole some dutches from the store and he was walking in the street|||||@CallMeLean @SOrtbals millions of Americans have survived stealing smokes and walking in the street.  Neither of which warrant getting shot.|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals lol but are you suppose to steal and walk in the street though? Just because everyone doesn't mean you have too|||||@CallMeLean @SOrtbals that's right and just because you do doesn't mean you deserve to get shot. Put Mike Brown aside, look at the problem.|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals the problem is that you trust cops like they are your first line of defense... You have to protect yourself always|||||@TyrellMayfield @CallMeLean Tyrell, wake up. Had he listened to the officer, and never stole, he would be alive today. 6-4 300# fighting cop|||||@SOrtbals and had the #Ferguson PD not overreacted to the response of their citizens we might not have had riots on our hands.  @CallMeLean|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals the police department? No it's a individual with a gun that enforces laws on others legally|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals and what are you suppose to do when people start tearing shit up... Let them?|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals not like they took the man out as a unit and hung him it was a individual that got into a altercation with another|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals is he was walking on the side walk shit would've been good, if he would've payed for the dutches he would be good|||||@CallMeLean @SOrtbals &amp; somebody else would've died. Theis incident aside, there is an undeniable problem with that Police Dept. Agreed?|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals I'm tired of people saying it's a problem but not wiling to fix it, go be a cop and solve the problem|||||@CallMeLean I am. What do you do for a living? Odd that I'm trying to fix your problem? Confused I have to explain this to you. @SOrtbals|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals I have no problem I just don't understand where rioting and breaking shit gets you|||||It gets you nowhere. ==&gt; "@CallMeLean: @TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals .....I just don't understand where rioting and breaking shit gets you‚Äù|||||@CallMeLean where does shooting unarmed men for walking in the street get you? @SOrtbals|||||@TyrellMayfield @SOrtbals no where but I'm just sayings lot of people was wrong that day but we just need to forgive even though it's hard|||||@CallMeLean lots of people were wrong, only one got dead. @SOrtbals|||||@TyrellMayfield @CallMeLean a lot of unarmed people have killed others, and the officer was armed, he gets knocked out, now offender has gun|||||@SOrtbals Steve, I see you're new to twitter.

SOrtbals @CallMeLean|||||@TyrellMayfield @CallMeLean what do you do?|||||@SOrtbals answering a question with a question is certainly evasive. I'm a military policeman by trade. I dabble elsewhere.  @CallMeLean|||||To be honest @CallMeLean what #Furgeson needs is for YOU to go there and be a cop, not me.  @SOrtbals|||||@CallMeLean @SOrtbals so use your imagination and the word "de-escalate" to think about how the police response could have been different.|||||@TyrellMayfield @CallMeLean then go offer your expert advise. Tyrell your naive to what is going on. Wake up|||||@TyrellMayfield uh, yes they are paramilitary. Are you a cop? Have you been through the 6 month long academy?|||||@SOrtbals got a link or reference about police being "shot at every night since Mike Brown was shot."? I'm interested in reading abt that.|||||@TyrellMayfield I don't have to do your homework, look it up yourself. You seem to be the expert on police response and riot control.|||||@SOrtbals i suspect it's because it didn't happen. But ok.|||||@TyrellMayfield http://t.co/Fulvbwkg4W|||||@SOrtbals ahhh the old Fox News. Thanks for that.|||||@TyrellMayfield I'm guessing an interview since its on Fox news is not valid?|||||@SOrtbals valid as any other cable news network. If indeed police officers were shot at it'll be reported &amp; corroborated in other sources.|||||@TyrellMayfield with the spin this story is getting, I don't think people care about what they do to the police.|||||@SOrtbals how does that make you feel?|||||@TyrellMayfield how does what make me feel? I'm sick about this entire event. They are possibly rioting over a good shoot.|||||@shortbals there's only one man alive who knows if it was good or not. You stay safe out there. Keep your head about you.|||||@TyrellMayfield thank you. National guard is on its way now also. Should be interesting.|||||@shortbals Stay in touch.|||||@SOrtbals I did a cursory search on the web, found nothing to corroborate the chief's statement.|||||@TyrellMayfield of course not, why would they try and paint the picture that police are always in harm's way?|||||@SOrtbals Steve! (I feel like I know you) despite your refusal to answer my question I've deduced you're a LEO in the STL area. #AmIRight?|||||The range of a hand gun is far less than the rifle on too of the armored vehicle.  @TyrellMayfield @GrayConnolly @PaulSzoldra @BmoreConetta|||||@TyrellMayfield @PaulSzoldra @BmoreConetta @jbowtie that isn‚Äôt policing.|||||@TyrellMayfield The cops in #Ferguson  are like kids posing showing off new toys.They can't even operate the equipment.They're too stupid.|||||@PaulSzoldra @BmoreConetta no law...

A lot of soldiers choose not to wear knee/elbow pads to reduce weight &amp; move easier|||||@hoodriderzstl ah, yeah, cops don't need to run, they just shoot.|||||@CassandraRules sadly, THIS is what happens when Obama cuts on Military spending.|||||@cassandrarules http://t.co/AIT7xh0liT what are the people going to do? #riseup #JusticeForMikeBrown|||||@CassandraRules - they couldn't wait to try on their new clothes. Even when it wasn't necessary. Nor was the shooting.
1126	3	If Michael Brown had been carrying a gun, would Republicans still say he had a right to bear arms? Or is that only for white men? #ferguson|||||@saveNRG Of course he does wtf?|||||@WizardofWoz_ I think you missed the point.|||||@saveNRG no I get it you're race baiting. It's stupid. You wanna end racism? Then stop making everything a race issue|||||@WizardofWoz_ When African Americans are stopped by police at a disproportionately high rate, it is a race issue.|||||@WizardofWoz_ Whether you want to believe it or not, evidence shows that police all around the country frequently use their own personal|||||@saveNRG I totally agree with that. I'm just saying what's most important right now is an unarmed civilian was murdered. Not his race.|||||@WizardofWoz_ racial biases when deciding what people to stop.|||||@saveNRG definitely food for thought thank you.|||||@WizardofWoz_ of course. Any citizen thats shot without a good reason is an issue, but I do believe this has a lot to do with race. I havent|||||@WizardofWoz_ heard any reason for the officer to think of him as suspicious, other than the fact that he was a black teen.And unfortunately|||||@WizardofWoz_ sometimes that's all it takes.|||||@WizardofWoz_ how would they advance their agenda if they didn't hide behind race baiting? @saveNRG|||||@saveNRG How utterly ridiculous. If he had a gun, and he had a license to carry it, he would have been within his rights to bear arms.|||||@PeckPolitics I'm glad you think so. But many people would automatically assume that a black teen with a gun was a dangerous criminal.|||||@saveNRG Well, remember in most states you must be 21 to have a concealed carry license. In Missouri it's 23.|||||@saveNRG Strike that, In Missouri it is 21.|||||@saveNRG In most states, if someone saw a teenager with a handgun on the street. That probably would set off alarm bells.

Surely you want in.|||||@bobbytweetz so enlighten me Bobby.... what happened for this 18 yr old to wind up dead?|||||@jkmoyers at best a cop abandons training and kills surrendering suspect after a struggle, and at worst a heart of racial hatred covered up.|||||@bobbytweetz another fair point.  But, why do we automatically assume the latter? looting and burning buildings under the assumption.|||||@jkmoyers it depends who "we" is. I used to be a prosecutor and I always believed the police until I realized what was what.|||||@bobbytweetz 1/2 We in this case would b most of twitter verse. As a prosecutor I would imagine u had a different perspective than most.|||||@jkmoyers honestly I didn't see it as a prosecutor. It was only after I moved to the inner city and saw how my neighbors were treated.|||||@bobbytweetz 2/2 but you know also that it is dangerous to paint every cop with the same broad stroke.|||||@jkmoyers I don't paint every officer as bad. Just the ones that empty their guns into unarmed kids and then cover it up.|||||@bobbytweetz we'll just have to see what comes of it but I do appreciate the conversation.|||||@jkmoyers same, have a great night.|||||@jkmoyers I know many officers with great respect for the law and I admire them deeply.|||||@bobbytweetz listen, we all want justice. I'm just trying to remove the emotion from the equation and look at it rationally.|||||@jkmoyers the Sons of Liberty paid taxes and the Queen ignored their needs, much like #ferguson today. Real Americans should see themselves.|||||@bobbytweetz @jkmoyers LOL actually it was a king and it started by expelling royal officials because we didn't recognize taxing authority|||||@robtr2 @jkmoyers actually they were putting troops in our homes and making us pay for a government that didn't work for us.|||||@bobbytweetz @jkmoyers that happened after we expelled the royal officials sunshine.|||||@bobbytweetz @robtr2 So the issue at hand is that the people in Ferguson feel marginalized and that there needs are being ignored.|||||@jkmoyers they have been getting their asses handed to them by the police for years. The system is unresponsive to their needs.|||||@jkmoyers check out those stats on the stops and arrests by police versus the racial makeup of the city. Ghastly 14th amendment violations.|||||@bobbytweetz 1/2 then by all means, something should be done to rectify that. I guess my thing with this is that you loose the high ground|||||@jkmoyers I agree with that point. I just don't think it's fair to point fingers when our country was founded for the same reasons.|||||@jkmoyers when people have run out of options, and all democratic systems appear to have failed, what are people left to do?|||||@jkmoyers I don't agree with rioting, but that's because my country's democratic systems have always worked for me and mine.|||||@bobbytweetz when you loose control of your behavior.  The looting just feeding into the stereotype.|||||@robtr2 but wait, maybe you're right. John Adams was like, c'mon men! Let's not recognize that taxing authority!|||||@bobbytweetz You're right, he rose to prominence as a vehement opponent of the stamp act in 1765|||||@robtr2 c'mon men! He said from the old south meeting house, let's get mad over the stamps! Did I tell you the trout spit gold on this land?|||||@bobbytweetz since you believed a Queen was running England at the time I don't expect you to know what the stamp act was|||||@robtr2 haha I was only being sarcastic about the queen. I'm from Boston. Used to take our kids on the freedom trail tours.|||||@robtr2 c'mon men! Let's risk our lives and families because the taxing authority is unrecognizable! I have land for sale in Alaska.|||||@bobbytweetz that did start it but the Brits sending troops after we kicked them out escalated it into a war. God Save the Queen LOL|||||@jkmoyers @ProfessorCrunk there is a thing in the US constitution (twice!!) called "due process"|||||@__YoungPhenom__ @ProfessorCrunk due process only works if you are not in fear of your own safety.  it's understood... Don't assault a cop.|||||@jkmoyers and if police account is true (see land tweet above) once he was neutralized cuff him and give him a trial, not empty your clip.|||||@bobbytweetz that is a fair point, which I completely agree with you on.|||||RT @ProfessorCrunk: Destruction of property and destruction of life are false equivalents. #MikeBrown #Ferguson|||||@ProfessorCrunk thanks for taking an honest question, to you, and trolling it out.  Classy.
