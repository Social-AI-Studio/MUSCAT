    "Title": "Did a Singapore Foreign Service Officer reach a milestone of folding her 1000th Banquet Napkin?  ",
    "Tags": [],
    "Paragraphs": "\nNope.\u00a0 The source of the above caption is a satirical website called Singapore Policy Diary, which we note, came into existence pretty recently, on 13 February 2019.\n\nOn 4 July 2019, we came across an eyebrow raising post claiming the following:\n\u201cForeign Service Officer thrilled to fold 1000th banquet napkin\nPSC-MFA scholar and current Foreign Service Officer Goh Ru Lyn has expressed her delight at recording her thousandth folded napkin. She becomes the fastest ever officer to reach the milestone, a mere three weeks and four days after starting work at MFA. Ms Goh attributed her success to a deep commitment to the public service.\u201c\nIf you thought the starting paragraph was weird (and hilarious), it gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it) further down.\u00a0 We are treated next to choice statements such as:\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re folding your fiftieth napkin of the day, and your fingers are blistering and your nails are cracking, external rewards won\u2019t motivate you. What kept me going was the knowledge that every crease, every point, and every fan was crucial to maintaining good diplomatic ties with our neighbours. At the end of the day, I could look at all my little Bishop\u2019s Hats, and count the good I did for our country. How many people can say that?\u201d\n\u201cHer performance grade for this year will definitely be an A,\u201d commented one senior MFA insider, who declined to be named. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably get six months\u2019 bonus in December.\nHer Current Estimated Potential\u2019s probably been bumped up two grades.\nMs Goh got into a heated argument with her scholarship officer over where she would do her Master\u2019s. She eventually gave in to HR\u2019s demands and pursued an MA in Global Thought at Columbia University, instead of joining MIT\u2019s prestigious Security Studies programme. Despite her unhappiness at the time, Ms Goh has since graciously admitted it was for the best.\n\u201cI was convinced MFA only wanted me to go to Columbia because of the group discount PSC has on Master\u2019s degrees there,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut they\u2019ve always had the country\u2019s best interests, which are of course also my best interests, at heart. I had so much time in New York to host dinner parties and practise folding napkins. If I\u2019d gone to MIT, I\u2019d have been much too busy writing papers, trawling databases, and generally becoming an expert on Southeast Asian security issues to learn the skills necessary for a Foreign Service career. It\u2019s not like knowing the difference between Subic Bay and Fiery Cross Reef is going to help me decide between a Rosebud Fold or a Triple Pocket.\u201d\nNone of the above statements are true.\nGoh Ru Lyn does not exist.\u00a0 Neither do government-career-milestones measured in terms of napkin folding.\nWell, some hints of the article are true \u2013 like the mention of the Masters of Arts in Global Thought programme from Columbia University.\u00a0 This is actually true \u2013 Columbia University in the US actually offers the said programme, stating that it is an \u201cinterdisciplinary academic course of study that challenges students to explore new concepts and categories intended to encompass and explain the complexities of our interconnected and changing world.\u201d\u00a0 We do note however, that whether the programme is so loosely conducted that one would have plenty of time to host dinner parties and allow practicing in folding napkins is unproven.\nAlso the concept of \u201cCurrent Estimated Potential\u201d, which is basically an estimate of how high a Public Service Division employee can rise (Read about it here).\nSo how do we know that this is a satirical website (other than from the ridiculously funny content that is objectively obviously untrue)?\nWell, the website says so.\u00a0 Its website banner states unequivocally:\n\u201cReading between the lines of the Singapore Policy Journal (this is a satire blog; we are fake news).\u00a0 Like us at https://www.facebook.com\u2026\u201d\nIt also has a General Disclaimer that reads:\n\u201cThis is a parody and satire blog; any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is either unintentional or in good fun.\u00a0 Please let me know if you want something taken down.\u201c\n\nGood satire however, is a work of art.\nDustin Griffin says in his book \u201cSatire: A Critical Reintroduction\u201d, \u201cA work of satire is designed to attack vice or folly.\u00a0 To this end it uses wit or ridicule.\u00a0 Like polemical rhetoric, it seeks to persuade an audience that something or someone is reprehensible or ridiculous; unlike pure rhetoric, it engages in exaggeration and some sort of fiction. But satire does not forsake the \u201creal world\u201d entirely.\u00a0 Its victims come from that world, and it is this fact (together with a darker or sharper tone) that separates satire from pure comedy.\u00a0 Finally, satire usually proceeds by means of clear reference to some moral standards or purpose\u201c.\nSo what does the Singapore Policy Journal seek to ridicule?\nWell clearly, it expresses a perceived frustration with the career path of Foreign Service Officers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore.\u00a0 It suggests a career of rigidity and a loss of freedom so intense that even choosing one\u2019s field of study is based on the \u201ccountry\u2019s best interests\u201c, and career achievement (and therefore, how CEP is determined) is mired in trivial matters such as how well a dinner with foreign delegates is run.\nWe don\u2019t know if the MFA agrees.\u00a0 We do know that the outspoken Bilahari Kausikan had this to say about the post:\n\nWe would agree \u2013 Take it with that handful of salt.\u00a0 Laugh about it.\u00a0 And maybe consider that career achievement is probably something that one should choose to define for oneself, with as much research and knowledge that one can do.\u00a0 We say, ultimately:\n\nFind your Ikigai.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for a laugh about Singapore government related topics, the following satirical articles by Singapore Policy Diary come highly recommended:\nNUS expels 800+ students for plagiarism over identical petition\nArmy scholars talk about something other than OCS during dinner\nMOE cancels plans to abolish streaming after receiving petition with 17,000 signatures\nParliament: New CPIB director has \u2018no conflict of interest\u2019, despite acrimonious university breakup with Senior Minister of State\n",
