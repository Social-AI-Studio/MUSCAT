    "Tags": [],
    "Paragraphs": "\n\nYou may have come across a Whatsapp or Telegram text message asking you to access a website to claim S$2,800 from the government.\n\nThis is a scam.\u00a0 There is no such offer being made by the Singapore government.\nThe link in the message will take you to another website that claims to be part of the Ministry of Manpower and ask for information from you.\u00a0 It will also ask you to forward the link to 5 other persons in order to claim the S$2,800.\nWe suspect that the website is attempting to phish for personal information from users of the website.\nThe Ministry of Manpower has issued a warning on its Facebook page:\n\nSo keep your family, friends and loved ones informed about this scam.\u00a0 Hopefully, their web browser would have detected the website as a deceptive site, so that all harm is prevented:\n\n",
