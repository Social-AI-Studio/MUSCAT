    "Paragraphs": "\n[Editorial update: 20 May, 11:30am] We\u2019ve updated the section on repatriation flights to India for clarity. The rating remains unchanged.\n\u2013\nOn 18 May, an article on Indian newspaper Hindustan Times made its rounds on social media platforms like Facebook and was being forwarded furiously on messaging platforms like WhatsApp.\n\nThe article reports that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had warned of a \u201cnew variant of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) found in Singapore\u201d and that this variant \u201ccan result in India\u2019s third wave\u201d. He also added that the strain is \u201cextremely dangerous for children\u201d and urged the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government to \u201cimmediately halt air services with Singapore\u201d and to prioritise vaccinations for children.\nSingapore publication Mothership notes that while his comments were also reported on other English-language news media in India such as The Hindu,\u00a0NDTV, and\u00a0The Economic Times, Hindustan Times was the only outlet that used the term \u201cSingapore virus\u201d.\nA photo taken from what looks to be a news broadcast was also being forwarded on WhatsApp:\n\nWe also came across a video which appears to be a screen recording of a post on India Today\u2019s Facebook page. In the video, it is mentioned that there is a \u201cnew Singapore strain\u201d that is impacting children, and that the Indian health ministry is closely monitoring it.\n\nhttps://blackdotresearch.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WhatsApp-Video-2021-05-19-at-7.55.13-AM.mp4\nNeedless to say, Singaporeans have taken umbrage at what was being reported \u2013 not only due to its factual inaccuracies, but also how the strain was dubbed the \u2018Singapore virus\u2019.\nThere is quite a bit to unpack, but let\u2019s first go into checking if the claims made contain any ounce of truth in them.\nClaim #1: There is a new variant of COVID-19 found in Singapore\nAccording to Mr Kejriwal, there appears to be an entirely new variant of COVID-19, and that it originated in Singapore.\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) responded to this claim on 18 May, saying that there is \u201cno truth whatsoever\u201d in this claim and that \u201cthere is no \u2018Singapore variant'\u201d.\nIn fact, the strain that has been prevalent in many recently reported COVID-19 cases is the B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India. \u201cPhylogenetic testing has shown this B16172 variant to be associated with several clusters in Singapore,\u201d said MOH.\nSome Indian netizens have also taken to Twitter to call out the inaccuracy of Mr Kejriwal\u2019s claim:\n\n\nTherefore, it is false that there is a new variant of COVID-19 found in Singapore.\n\nClaim #2: This variant is \u201cextremely dangerous for children\u201d\nNext, Mr Kejriwal mentions that the strain is \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d for children, and urged the central government to prioritise vaccinations for them.\nPerhaps Mr Kejriwal had added a very generous sprinkling of salt to comments made by Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on 16 May at a press conference by the multi-ministry taskforce (MTF). Then, he addressed the recent rise in cases of children being tested positive for COVID-19. Chan said that the B.1.617 strain appears to be more virulent and seems to attack younger children, but assured that none of the children who were infected are seriously ill.\nRegardless, the new strain is still \u201can area of concern\u201d, and it was announced on the same day that all primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute, will be shifting to full home-based learning from 19 May until the end of term on 28 May.\nTherefore, the claim that the strain is \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d for children is false.\n\nClaim #3: Flight services to India from Singapore have yet to be halted\nFinally, Mr Kejriwal urged the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government to \u201cimmediately halt air services with Singapore\u201d, perhaps as a means of keeping the variant out of India.\nIf Mr Kejriwal had done a simple Google search before crafting his tweet, he would have realised that this is already in place.\nIn response to his comment, Indian Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri came forward in a Twitter post to clarify that international flights to India have been halted since March last year, and that Singapore has no air travel bubble in India. He was quoted as saying: \u201cWe just bring back Indian people stranded there with some Vande Bharat flights. They are our own people. We still have an eye on the situation. All precautions are being taken,\u201d referring to repatriation flights.\nOn the High Commission of India in Singapore\u2019s website, we see a press release issued 5 May that Indian nationals who wish to return to India should immediately register themselves, and the flight schedule from Singapore would be announced. It added that all passengers will be screened before departure, and only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to board the flight. Upon arrival, all passengers will be screened and would be quarantined for 14 days. Following that, a COVID test would be done. When we took a look at the flight schedule uploaded on HCI\u2019s website, we see scheduled repatriation flights from Singapore happening from 11 to 31 May.\nSince 24 April, all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to India within the last 14 days would also not be allowed entry into Singapore. This includes visitors who transit\u00a0in India, and all who had obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore.\nTherefore, the claim that flights to India from Singapore (other than repatriation flights) have yet to be halted is false.\n\nMinister of External Affairs, India: \u201cDelhi CM does not speak for India.\u201d\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in Singapore said in a press statement on 19 May that it \u201cregrets the unfounded assertions made on Facebook and Twitter\u201d and that they are \u201cdisappointed that a prominent political figure had failed to ascertain the facts before making such claims\u201d. MFA added that they met High Commission of India P Kumaran in the morning to \u201cexpress these concerns\u201d.\nForeign Minister Vivian Balakrishan also tweeted in response to Mr Kejriwal\u2019s comments, stating that \u201cpoliticians should stick to facts\u201d:\n\nPoliticians should stick to facts!There is no \u201cSingapore variant\u201d. https://t.co/SNJaF7wkwC https://t.co/pNgw4bkV4H\n\u2014 Vivian Balakrishnan (@VivianBala) May 19, 2021\n\nIndia\u2019s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar took to Twitter and called the comments \u201cirresponsible\u201d and that Mr Kejriwal \u201cdoes not speak for India\u201d.\n\nArindam Bagchi the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs in India tweeted saying that the Singapore Government conveyed \u201cstrong objection\u201d to Mr Kejriwal\u2019s comments on a \u2018Singapore variant\u2019. The Indian High Commissioner then clarified that Mr Kejriwal has \u201cno competence to pronounce on Covid variants or civil aviation policy\u201d.\n\nSingapore Government called in our High Commissioner today to convey strong objection to Delhi CM's tweet on \"Singapore variant\". High Commissioner clarified that Delhi CM had no competence to pronounce on Covid variants or civil aviation policy.\n\u2014 Arindam Bagchi (@MEAIndia) May 19, 2021\n\nNot just a matter of semantics\nIt is interesting to note that at the time of writing, Hindustan Times has tweaked its headline and removed the words \u201cSingapore virus\u201d:\n\nHOWEVER, the article still reflects information that has already been proven to be inaccurate \u2013 that there is a new variant that originated from Singapore, that it is extremely dangerous for children, and that flights between Singapore and India are still ongoing.\nInaccuracies aside, what\u2019s even more problematic, and what most have taken issue over is how downright xenophobic the term \u2018Singapore\u00a0virus\u2019 is.\nThis is akin to how COVID-19 had been referred to as the \u2018Wuhan virus\u2019, \u2018China virus\u2019, and \u2018Chinese virus\u2019 by regular people and politicians alike last year. For example, former US President Donald Trump had repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the \u2018Chinese virus\u2019:\n\n\n\n\nEven when asked by a reporter on why he\u2019s adamant on using the term, Mr Trump defended his stance, saying that \u201cit\u2019s not racist at all [\u2026] because it comes from China\u201d.\n\u201cI want to be accurate,\u201d said Mr Trump, ignoring the fact that there had been increased reports of anti-Asian discrimination, anti-Asian content on Twitter, and anti-Asian violence around that time. According to a report by non-profit coalition Stop AAPI Hate, there were 3,795 anti-Asian hate incidents reported across the country between March 2020 and February 2021.\nIn a commentary titled \u201cTime to stop the use of \u2018Wuhan virus\u2019, \u2018China virus\u2019 or \u2018Chinese virus\u2019 across the scientific community\u201d, authors note that while naming a virus after a geographic location or group of people is \u201cnot unheard-of\u201d, for example, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), \u201chaving precedence is not a de facto justification for using these alternatives, as mentioned above, to SARS-CoV-2\u201d. The authors argue that such terms don\u2019t just hinder the public\u2019s understanding and perception of COVID-19, but are \u201cbiased\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d as it equates a city, a nation, and the Chinese people to a virus.\n\n\nDr. Marietta Vazquez, a professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases & General Pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, also spoke out about seeing \u2018#ChinaVirus\u2019 and \u2018#WuhanVirus\u2019 trending in the US. She noted that while there is \u201cunderstandable unease\u201d about the increasing spread of COVID-19, \u201cit\u2019s important to remember that words matter and the language we use has power\u201d and that \u201cstigma associated with referring to an illness in a way that deliberately creates unconscious (or conscious) bias\u201d.\nBringing it back to the current context, Singaporeans have understandably reacted so strongly to the term \u2018Singapore virus\u2019 and the claims being made because, like what was quoted, it equates Singapore and Singaporeans to a strain of COVID-19. We have fortunately not heard of any discrimination or violence towards Singaporeans stemming from Mr Kejriwal\u2019s comment, but this could be a possibility if such claims are not nipped in the bud and corrected.\nAt the same time, Singaporeans also need to be careful in not engaging in tit-for-tat behaviour by dubbing the strain the \u2018India virus\u2019 even if, according to Trump\u2019s logic, it originated in India. By doing so, it\u2019s simply perpetuating biases against people of a particular nationality with such imprudent use of words.\nIn our factchecking experience we have noted, rather worryingly, many false claims being made about Indian nationals living in Singapore. From a netizen alleging that a planned act of terrorism on two mosques was done by an Indian national to how \u201call sex crimes\u201d in Singapore were committed by said individuals, what\u2019s actually more unsettling is the sheer number of netizens who vehemently agree with these claims without verifying them.\nThe end of the pandemic already seems as far away as it already is, with the virus evolving quicker than scientists can react. Therefore, the best we can all do in our various capacities is to always remind ourselves that the enemy is a common one, and in this fight, words really do matter.\n\n\n",
