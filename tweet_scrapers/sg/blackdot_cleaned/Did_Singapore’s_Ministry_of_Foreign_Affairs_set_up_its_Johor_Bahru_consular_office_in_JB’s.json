    "Paragraphs": "\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve been receiving a Whatsapp message claiming that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA Singapore) has set up its Johor Bahru consular office in JB\u2019s City Square Mall, do note\u2026 It\u2019s fake news!\n\nThe exact same fake news started spreading in June 2018, but MFA Singapore quickly confirmed on 21 June 2018 that the information was false.\nSurprising to see that this old fake news is re-circulating now! Be on guard against it.\nAll you need to know about MFA Singapore in Johor Bahru is here.\n\n",
