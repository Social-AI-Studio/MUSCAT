    "Paragraphs": "\n\n\nThis image was seen circulating around 9GAG on Monday, claiming that it was a restaurant in Singapore.\u00a0 It attracted quite a few laughs because while the old saying goes that \u201cThe Customer is Always Right\u201d, this clearly isn\u2019t something this restaurant believes in!\nThis image is misleading and mis-captioned.\n\nBased on reverse image searches we performed and further research, we\u2019ve established that the restaurant is actually in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, and not in Singapore.\nThe tell-tale sign was in the final cheeky poster which stated:\n\u201cIf you\u2019re arrogant, grouchy, irritable, or just a pain in the arse, there\u2019ll be a RM10 charge for putting up with your shit\u201c.\nIf it was a restaurant in Singapore, it wouldn\u2019t charge in ringgit (RM).\n\u00a0\nWe also found a mandarin article about this restaurant posted some 9 months ago, which described it as a Johor Bahru claypot chicken rice restaurant.\u00a0 You can read about this restaurant here , known as\n\u98d8\u9999\u7802\u9505\u9e21\u996d\nand if you\u2019re interested to pay a visit, you can check out their Facebook page here.\n\n",
