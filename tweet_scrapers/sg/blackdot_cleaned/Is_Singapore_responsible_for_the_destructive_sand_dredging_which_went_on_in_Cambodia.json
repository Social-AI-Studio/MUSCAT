    "Paragraphs": "\n\nFacebook link to Emergence Magazine \u2013 Article featuring Lost World with commentary by Director\nWe are unable to determine if this is true, and we explain why.\nRecently, we came to know of the new film \u201cLost World\u201d, circulating around social media \u2013 This film has nothing to do with the \u201cJurassic Park\u201d franchise. Instead, \u201cLost World\u201d is an approximately 16 minute documentary film directed by Ms Kalyanee Mam. The documentary focuses on sand dredging activities in Cambodia which the director says, is destroying the coastline mangrove forests of Cambodia. Much of the sand dredged is allegedly shipped to Singapore for its construction and land reclamation needs.\nYou can view the director\u2019s commentary and the documentary here.\nThe anger against Singapore is visceral and scathing, to say the least. In the director\u2019s own words:\n\u201cNever before have I witnessed the mass movement of land from one country to another, not for farming, not for housing or economic development, but for pure unadulterated entertainment. Since 2007, Singapore imported over 80 million tons of sand, worth more than $740 million, from Cambodia. Marina Bay Sands\u2014a 55-story hotel, resort, and casino valued at $6.6 billion, which includes the land cost\u2014is considered the most expensive stand-alone casino property in the world. Gardens by the Bay, a billion-dollar garden theme park, is built on top of 250 acres of sand or reclaimed land. The theme park purports to introduce its visitors to \u201ca mysterious world veiled in mist,\u201d where they can \u201clearn about rare plants and their fast-disappearing environment\u201d; a world grounded on \u201cthe principles of environmental sustainability.\u201d It is ironic that a place that aims to teach concepts of environmental sustainability is literally built on a foundation that is not environmentally sustainable at all.\u201d\nIs this true? Is Singapore responsible for this destruction, if it is happening at all?\nLet\u2019s sift out what we know to be fact.\nSand is necessary for building and construction. It is critical for the making of concrete. Furthermore, not any sand will suffice \u2013 Sand from the desert is generally too fine to be used. The best sand is sand from freshwater rivers and marine sand which has been treated to be free from salt.\u00a0 Sand is the third most used resource on the planet, and around 50 billion tons of sand and gravel are used around the world every year. Over-mining for sand will cause environmental damage to the coast, and this has been reported to have happened in Cambodia before.\nSingapore does import sand. It imports sand and granite on a commercial basis, from various suppliers, who source their sand from neighbouring countries. In fact, documents from the United Nations state that: \u201cHaving imported a reported 517 million tonnes of sand in the last 20 years, Singapore is by far the largest importer of sand world-wide\u2026 and the world\u2019s highest per capita consumer of sand at 5.4 tonnes per inhabitant\u201d.\nAccording to the same UN report, Singapore imports sand typically from Indonesia, but also from Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia. Note however, that Cambodia sand imports have ceased since a total ban was put in place by the Cambodian government in 2016.\nSingapore does have strict licencing requirements for its suppliers. These suppliers must be licenced by the Building and Construction Authority to provide such material.\u00a0 We note however, that the licensing scheme does not apply to \u201cany consignment solely for use in land reclamation works along the coast of Singapore and in any ship or vessel without landing in Singapore\u201d.\nSince independence, Singapore has actively reclaimed land to enlarge the size of Singapore. From 581.5 square kilometres, Singapore\u2019s land mass today is 724.2 square kilometres.\nBiblioasia, from the National Library of Singapore, has mentioned that:\n\u201cSince the first reclamation project carried out in 1822, fill materials have traditionally comprised soil excavated from inland hills and sand dredged from surrounding seabeds. By the mid-1980s, however, these resources began to run out and Singapore had to import sand from neighbouring countries. This soon became a problem when the cost of foreign sand skyrocketed from less than $20 per sq m in the 1970s to $200 per sq m in the 90s. The situation hit crisis levels when Malaysia and Indonesia banned the export of sand to Singapore in 1997 and 2007 respectively.\u201d\nMore information on the details of Singapore\u2019s land reclamation is described in detail here.\nHas Cambodia banned the export of sand previously?\nYes. In fact, this happened twice, in 2009 and in 2016. This appears to be an undisputed fact. The 2009 also appeared to be a limited ban, which reduced the amount of sand imported, while the latter ban appeared to be a total ban on all sand exports.\nAlso see a 2017 article relating to Cambodian sand imports into Singapore here.\nThe consistent position from the Singapore government is that:\n\u2013 Singapore sets strict criteria for imports of sand, including on environmental protection, but reiterated that sand is imported on a commercial basis and it is the contractors who must meet the criteria. It also said that Singapore has not come across any illegal shipments of sand here.\n\u2013 Singapore does not condone the illegal export or smuggling of sand, or any extraction of sand that is in breach of the source countries\u2019 laws and rules on environmental protection. In addition to the Building and Construction Authority, the government agency Jurong Town Corporation monitors the sand imports and investigates sand suppliers as part of overseeing Singapore\u2019s land reclamation activities.\nKeep in mind that it is true that Singapore does recognise bans \u2013 In 2007, when the Indonesian government banned sand exports for environmental reasons, Singapore\u2019s construction sector nearly came to a halt. The BCA had to release its stockpile of sand to keep construction continuing.\nWhy we have difficulty confirming if the Lost World is accurate in its accusations\nAs the director herself acknowledges, Singapore is a buyer of sand. The mining is done by private companies granted concessions by the Cambodian government to dredge for sand. Singapore cannot possibly control what goes on in Cambodia if the Cambodian government fails to protect its own shores.\nAnother problem lies with illegal sand mining. While Singapore can take the position that it will refuse illegally mined sand, it also cannot guarantee that it will catch every instance of false declarations by sellers on the origin of the sand being supplied.\nWhat the director needs is evidence that Singapore is knowingly buying sand which is illegally obtained and thereby promoting the environmental destruction of its ASEAN neighbour and importing sand for its own benefit. But this is not clear from the video. Regrettably, without this element, there is a gap in the picture, and it would be unfair to conclude that Singapore is directly responsible for the alleged environmental harm suffered by the people who live and work in the coastal mangrove regions of Cambodia.\nDo note however, that it remains true that the sand importing from Cambodia has stopped since 2017. Land reclamation is also now advancing towards new methods that may cease to require importing sand.\n\nThe Lost World is missing a crucial element establishing the knowledge of the Singapore Government in respect of Cambodia\u2019s environmental destruction.\n",
