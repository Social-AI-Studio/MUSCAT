    "Tags": [],
    "Paragraphs": "\nOn 19 March 2019, there were various alerts and videos reportedly stating that water had breached and entered a part of the MCE. Because the MCE is partially underground, some have speculated that seawater had entered the MCE and the MCE was not safe, while others speculated that a pipe had burst in the MCE.\n\nWhile the fact of water entering the MCE is probably true, it is unclear if the water is seawater leakage or simply a burst pipe. We would like to highlight that the latter event had happened twice in the past \u2013 relating to burst pipes and sprinkler systems. There has not been an issue of a structural defect in the MCE leading to seawater leaking.\nSee news of the first incident in 2015, here.\nNews on the second incident in 2018, here and here.\n\nUPDATE:\nThis has been clarified \u2013 The Land Transport Authority has explained it to be an accidental triggering of the fire fighting sprinkler system.\n\nHence, the allegations are fake news.\n\n",
