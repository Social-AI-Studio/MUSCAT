    "Paragraphs": "\nOn 5 February 2019, the States Times / Singapore Herald published a post alleging that Minister for Manpower, Josephine Teo, had contradicted herself by alleging that the fertility rate in Singapore had \u201cdeclined but improved\u201d.\n\nThis is untrue.\n\nWe have reviewed the news videos of the statement by the Minister and no such statement was made.\n\nThe Minister had acknowledged the drop in the total fertility rate in Singapore. However, she had also stated that on another analysis, certain communities of the Singapore population had shown improvement in their fertility rate. She was also explaining that steps were being taken to strengthen the support for young families in Singapore.\n\nRead about it here and here.\n",
