    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this post on Facebook:\n\nThe author of the Facebook post shares a screenshot of a tweet which mentions that four volunteers for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine developed Bell\u2019s palsy. There is also the insinuation that the photo attached of the three individuals were the affected participants from the vaccine trial.\nBelow is the original tweet by an independent journalist known as \u2018Spiro\u2019:\n\nFour Pfizer vaccine volunteers develop Bell's palsy\u2026\nBell's palsy is a condition that causes a weakness or paralysis of the muscles in the face\u2026\nThe condition causes one side of your face to droop or become stiff.https://t.co/aAaeEWUudH pic.twitter.com/SIGWx4WONH\n\u2014 Spiro (@o_rips) December 10, 2020\n\nAt time of publication, the tweet has garnered over 10k retweets and 15k likes.\nAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Bell\u2019s palsy symptoms (which may include drooping of the mouth, drooling, inability to close eye) appear suddenly over a 48 -72-hour period and generally start to improve with or without treatment after a few weeks. Its exact cause is unknown, but most scientists believe that reactivation of an existing (dormant) viral infection or impaired immunity may cause the disorder.\nFDA: No clear basis to conclude a causal relationship\nIn a briefing document by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine published 10 December, it was revealed that four vaccine participants developed Bell\u2019s palsy, out of the 44,000 total participants of the late-stage vaccine trial. None of the participants in the placebo group developed the condition.\nOn a separate note, there were a total of six deaths in the vaccine trial, with two deaths among those who got the vaccine and the other 4 who received a placebo.\nWhat the tweet didn\u2019t include, however, is the FDA stating several times in the document (on pages 6, 38, and 43) that the \u201cobserved frequency of reported Bell\u2019s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population\u201d and that \u201cthere is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time\u201d.\nAs a fact-check succinctly explained, \u201cboth deaths and cases of Bell\u2019s palsy observed during the trial occurred at a frequency consistent with that expected in an unvaccinated population\u201d and given that the frequency of the events were not higher than expected, \u201cthe evidence so far does not indicate that the vaccine caused these events\u201d.\nRegardless, the FDA is still recommending surveillance for cases of Bell\u2019s palsy with deployment of the vaccine into larger populations.\nA fact-check by Reuters also notes that the photo of the three individuals being shared was actually used on another article about Bell\u2019s palsy. It is important to note that the article was last updated on 20 November 2019, before COVID-19 (let alone its vaccine) was even made known to the world.\nTherefore, the photo being circulated is not one of the affected trial participants, and the insinuation that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine causes Bell\u2019s palsy is also likely false for now, unless more evidence surfaces to prove otherwise.\n\n",
