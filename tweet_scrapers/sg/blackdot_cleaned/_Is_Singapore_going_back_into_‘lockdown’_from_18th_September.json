    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this message being forwarded on WhatsApp:\n\nThe message states that it has been declared that Singapore will \u201cgo back into a state of lockdown (Heightened Alert)\u201d from 18 September 2021 for a month in response to the rise in COVID-19 cases.\nWhile there has indeed been a surge in cases recently, is it true that Singapore would therefore be heading into \u2018lockdown\u2019 once again?\n\nIf you\u2019ve been a loyal reader of our fact-checks, you must have felt a sense of deja vu, given that it was just 2 months ago that a similar message was being spread on WhatsApp. Then, it was mentioned that Singapore declared a month-long \u201cPhase 2 (Heightened Alert)\u201d from 19 July in response to a recent rise in COVID-19 cases due to the KTV clusters.\nIf you\u2019re a seasoned follower, you\u2019d also have recognised that the URL in the message is both suspiciously long and familiar.\nFor the unacquainted, while the first link\u00a0leads to CNA\u2019s main page, the\u00a0second link leads to once again our favourite finger-flipping furry \u2018friend\u2019.\nWe\u2019re not exactly sure who in Singapore is still falling for this trick, given that it has appeared in\u00a0multiple\u00a0instances\u00a0previously.\nRegardless, given that there has been no announcement nor indication that Singapore is heading back into \u201clockdown\u201d for a month from 18 September, the claim is false.\n\n",
