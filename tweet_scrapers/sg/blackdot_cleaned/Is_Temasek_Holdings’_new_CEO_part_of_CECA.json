    "Title": "Is Temasek Holdings\u2019 new CEO part of CECA?  ",
    "Tags": [],
    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this post on Facebook:\n\nThe author shares a link to an article which reports how Mr Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara will take over Ms Ho Ching as the new CEO of Temasek Holdings. Mr Pillay is currently the CEO of Temasek International and oversees its investment and portfolio activities, and played \u201cseveral critical roles\u201d in Temasek, including a two-year stint as head of the Americas.\nThe author then said that this piece of news meant that Temasek Holdings will soon be \u201crun by a CECA\u201d and questions if there aren\u2019t any \u201cqualified real Singaporeans\u201d to take over Ms Ho\u2019s position instead.\nWhile there were comments who agree with the author\u2019s sentiments (the group this article was posted in is already a clear indication of the inclination of these netizens), there were also some who came out to debunk the author\u2019s claims.\n\n\nAnother commenter even claims that Mr Pillay was his junior from Anglo-Chinese School (ACS):\n\nIn an exchange with a commenter, the author (indicated in blue) said that the headline on the website which states \u201cIndian origin\u201d and the website being Indian is justification of his claim.\n\nInterestingly enough, the author later mentioned that he \u201cstand(s) corrected\u201d with his claim:\n\nCECA: From trade agreement to slur\n\u201cCECA\u201d refers to the India \u2013 Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement which came into force 1 August 2005. However, the term has been used as a slur by certain netizens when referring to Indian nationals who live in Singapore, so much that the Government has needed to come forward to clarify misconceptions of the agreement, including how CECA does not give Indian nationals the right to take up citizenship or permanent residency and also that it does not oblige Singapore to automatically grant employment passes (EPs) to Indian nationals.\nWhen we took a look at the \u2018About Us\u2019 page of the website linked by the Facebook post\u2019s author, we see that they aim to \u201ctell the stories of Indians and people of Indian origins living out of India\u201d. It is also mentioned that these include stories of \u201cover 30 plus million NRIs and many more people who trace their origins back to India\u201d. Below are two other examples of where the term \u201cIndian-origin\u201d was also used:\n\nAs seen, it seems like the term is used simply as a means to identify individuals who can trace their roots back to India.\nRegardless, we decided to check on the claim by the netizen who says that Mr Pillay is an alumni of ACS. In a September 2014 newsletter for ACS (International), we see Mr Pillay mentioned alongside other notable ACS alumni:\n\nHe also studied law at the National University of Singapore and graduated in 1988.\nHe joined Temasek in 2010, and spent almost 20 years at Singapore law firm WongPartnership which he co-founded in 1992. In an article on Reuters, we learn that Mr Pillay has family roots in Sri Lanka, but grew up in Kuala Lumpur and spent most of his life in Singapore. An article on Bloomberg also mentions that he is Singaporean.\nAs mentioned above, the CECA agreement came into force only in 2005. Therefore, the claim that Mr Pillay came in as part of the CECA agreement is false.\n\nThis incident actually reminds us of another factcheck we did recently, where another netizen claimed that a Singaporean teen who was detained for planning attacks on two mosques in Singapore was a \u201cCECA youth\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, the article on India Today used the term \u201cIndian-origin\u201d and said that the teen was of \u201cIndian descent\u201d. However, there was no mention of the teen being from India and\u00a0reports of the incident on local\u00a0news\u00a0outlets revealed that the 16-year-old boy is actually Singaporean and a \u201cProtestant Christian of Indian ethnicity\u201d.\n",
