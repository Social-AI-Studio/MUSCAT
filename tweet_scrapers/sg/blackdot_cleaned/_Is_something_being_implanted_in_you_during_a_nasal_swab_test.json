    "Paragraphs": "\nIn this fact-check, we explore a rather\u2026interesting COVID-19 claim that recently went viral on Facebook.\n\nThe author poses two questions in his post:\n\nWhy can\u2019t COVID-19 testing be done using a saliva sample taken from the \u201chighly contagious mouth\u201d\nWhether there is something actually being implanted inside individuals during the rather invasive test\n\nHe reasoned that because \u201cmodern science\u201d can do \u201ccomplete DNA mapping\u201d by swabbing for a saliva sample from inside one\u2019s cheek, it doesn\u2019t \u201csound logical\u201d that testing for COVID-19 can\u2019t be done the same way.\nWhile seemingly unrelated, the author also brought up how individuals have been told to wear masks to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Perhaps this is simply to reiterate his assumption that an individual\u2019s saliva from the \u201chighly contagious mouth\u201d will contain the virus.\nThe post has been shared close to 320,000 times.\nYet another viral claim about the virus\nLet\u2019s first look into the question on whether or not the virus can be tested using a saliva sample.\nIn an article on The Straits Times, we read that the use of saliva to test for COVID-19 is actually being considered by health authorities in Singapore. The Ministry of Health (MOH) revealed that it will \u201ccontinue to review global and local clinical research and evidence on the feasibility of incorporating saliva testing into (its) testing regime\u201d.\nSaliva testing is being used in places like Hong Kong and Japan, and is used to test incoming travellers at their airports.\nHowever, there is also debate on how reliable saliva testing is in detecting the virus.\nAccording to Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader of infectious diseases and co-director of global health at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, the viral load in \u201cpure saliva\u201d is relatively low, whereas \u201csecretions from the back of the throat, which includes the oropharynx and nasopharynx, generally have a higher viral load\u201d.\nHe added that if done unsupervised, \u201cthe saliva collection may be done poorly or improperly, be it deliberately or inadvertently\u201d, and this could defeat the purpose of testing in the first place.\nIn a fact-check by PoliticFact on the viral (pun intended) Facebook post, we see them quoting Dr. Micah Bhatti, an infectious-diseases professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who mentioned that while \u201ctests can be performed on other specimen types that are less invasive, such as a throat swab [\u2026] they are less sensitive than the COVID-19 nasal swab test\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cSaliva is another specimen type that is being explored, but the jury is still out on that one.\u201d\nTherefore, we can conclude that while health experts aren\u2019t completely ruling out the possibility of saliva testing, it still has yet to be unanimously established as a reliable form of testing for COVID-19.\nAs for the claim that nasal swabbing could be a means to implant something inside individuals, it is amusing to note that a similar allegation had been made earlier in May:\n\n\n\n\nThis is what Bill Gates and George Soros want to do\u2026 Secretly stick you with a chip while testing you for the corona\u2026\nPosted by John Barno on\u00a0Sunday, 10 May 2020\n\n\u00a0\nThe claim was debunked by PolitiFact due to the lack of evidence.\nDr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease scientist at the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health had also told PoltiFact previously (in yet another fact-check which debunks the claim that the US government was going to develop an \u2018antivirus\u2019 that involves inserting a chip to track movements) that even the smallest microchips \u201care rather large\u201d. Said Dr. Chen: \u201cThe RFID chips that are routinely used for the tracking of pets are as small as a grain of rice \u2026 or in other words, they are as large as a grain of rice, and no vaccine needles in use are that large in diameter.\u201d\nThus, to date, there is no evidence that implantation of any kind is happening during swabbing. Therefore, we rate the claim as unproven.\n\n",
