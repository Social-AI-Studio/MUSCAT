    "Paragraphs": "\n\nWe have been alerted to this message being circulated on WhatsApp:\n\nThe message translates to: \u201cGreetings bro. Take note. I received information from a friend who works in NEA. He advised to inform your siblings and relatives that on this Hari Raya, please do not visit your relatives\u2019 houses. Also advise your children not to go visiting, because NEA and POLICE are doing plain clothes enforcement for those who go visiting. Please be advised.\u201d\nNot the first time we\u2019re hearing rumours about checks at residential units\nA few weeks ago, we did an article about several claims\u00a0regarding spot checks being done at households around Singapore as part of the enforcement of COVID-19 Circuit Breaker measures that prohibit social gatherings.\nThe Singapore Police Force came forward to deny the claims in a Facebook post, stating that they \u201cdo not proactively conduct checks at residential units\u201d to enforce safe distancing measures.\nThis time, the rumour has similarly been quashed by the Police in a Facebook post, which has stated that the claims being made are false.\n\n\n\n\n[FALSE RUMOUR ON NEA AND POLICE CHECKS ON RESIDENTIAL UNITS TO ENFORCE CIRCUIT BREAKER MEASURES] The Police would like\u2026\nPosted by Singapore Police Force on\u00a0Saturday, 9 May 2020\n\nThe post ends off with a reminder for individuals to refrain from spreading false rumours, and to comply with safe distancing measures.\n\u00a0\nThus, the claim that NEA and Police officers are doing checks on residential units during Hari Raya is false.\n\n",
