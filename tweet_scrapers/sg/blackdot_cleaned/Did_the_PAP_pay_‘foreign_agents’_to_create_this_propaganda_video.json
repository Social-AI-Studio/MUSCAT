    "Paragraphs": "\nWe have been alerted to this video being shared on Facebook:\n\nThe video comes with the caption: \u201cStupid PAP paying foreign agents to create propaganda!\u201d.\nPosted on 14 Jun, the 1:08 minute-long video is a mashup of what seems to be three separate clips, one of which depicts a group of individuals in sunglasses walking around with a framed up banner with phrases like \u201cVote PAP\u201d and \u201cSDP SUX\u201d. In a few frames, \u201cI love PAP\u201d in Chinese is also seen.\nThe second clip was taken from 1993 Hong Kong comedy Flirting Scholar, and the phrase \u201cVote For PAP\u201d in English and Chinese can be seen. In this clip, it\u2019s quite evident that some (pretty skilled, we have to admit) editing was done.\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison of screenshots we took from the movie (left) and the video on Facebook (right):\n\nThe final clip was taken from 1995 Hong Kong comedy A Chinese Odyssey: Part Two.\nAt time of publication, the Facebook post has been shared 68 times and viewed over 3,400 times.\nThe comment section of the post reveals mixed sentiments towards to the post and claim. There are commenters who are convinced that the video is legitimate and launched into criticisms of the PAP, while there are also those who assert that it was obviously edited, with one even suggesting that this was created by \u201cforeign entities to stoke internal problems among [Singaporeans]\u201d.\nThe answer is in the comments\nWhile it\u2019s apparent that there was editing involved in the 2nd clip, finding the original source of the first clip isn\u2019t as straightforward.\nHowever, we found the answer in the comments section, with a Facebook user sharing a link to a video posted on the official Facebook page of Vietnamese musician ST S\u01a1n Th\u1ea1ch.\n\nThe video was posted on 31 May, and seems to have been created to celebrate the musician\u2019s TikTok account hitting the 1 million followers milestone.\nDoing a quick check on his TikTok account, we see that the same video was posted on 31 May.\nBelow are side-by-side comparisons of the video posted by the Facebook user on 14 Jun (left) and on ST S\u01a1n Th\u1ea1ch\u2019s account on 31 May (right):\n\n\n\nIt is also important to note that in certain parts of the video posted by the Facebook user, what appears to be a watermark seems to have been blurred out.\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison of the same scene (edited video on the left, original on the right), and what could have been potentially hidden:\n\nTherefore, we rate the claim that the PAP paid \u201cforeign agents to create propaganda\u201d in the form of this video as false.\n\n",
