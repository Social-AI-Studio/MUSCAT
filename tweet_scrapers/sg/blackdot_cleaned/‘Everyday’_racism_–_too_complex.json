    "Paragraphs": "\n\nMaking \u2018race-related\u2019 comments while filming a fellow commuter. Using racial slurs while kicking a woman on the chest. Dubbing the B1617 variant that emerged from India as the \u2018Indian variant\u2019.\u00a0Websites fanning racism calling Indians \u2018cockroaches\u2019, \u2018rapists\u2019, etc.\u00a0Recent cases involving race and discrimination in Singapore have been causing a stir within the society, and by extension, the parliament.
