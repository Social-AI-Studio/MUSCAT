    "Paragraphs": "\n\nSome of you may remember that on 4 October 2019, Terry Xu, editor of The Online Citizen, had published a Facebook post about the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).\n\nEmbedded within his post was the following statement:\n\nThe words \u201cthe Hep C cover up prior to the GE 2015\u201d was a reference to the lapses at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in 2015, which contributed to a spate of Hepatits C infections in its wards affecting 25 patients, 8 of whom passed away.\u00a0 A post-mortem found that the virus infection was directly responsible for or contributed to 7 of these deaths.\nThe Ministry of Health was quick to call out Terry\u2019s statement as being a falsehood, and responded on 7 October 8.19am:\n\nThe basis for MOH\u2019s clarification is correct.\u00a0 The suggestion that there was a \u201cHep C cover up\u201d, based on what we have seen so far, is misleading.\n\nBased on 2 separate media reports and the report of the independent review committee (IRC), a summary of the key events were that:-\nThe Hepatitis C outbreak happened in 2015.\u00a0 Between April and September 2015, a cluster of 22 cases of acute Hepatitis C virus infections (HCV infections) were identified amongst patients in 2 renal wards at SGH.\nThe MOH was informed of the cluster of HCV infections in late August 2015.\u00a0 On 3 September 2015, Associate Professor Benjamin Ong, the MOH\u2019s director of Medical Services, met SGH clinicians to seek further clarifications and recommended further investigation and verification.\u00a0 Following that, on 4 September 2015, an MOH team visited the 2 renal wards for a process walkthrough with SGH.\nSGH presented its findings to the Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong) on 25 September 2015, and on 28 September 2015, MOH appointed the IRC to review the SGH\u2019s investigations and actions.\nOn 6 October 2015, news on the HCV infections was released by SGH.\u00a0 The MOH announced the setting up of the IRC.\nThe IRC found that some of SGH staff had deviated from the established standards for the handling of medical procedures such as blood taking, administering of intravenous medication, environmental cleaning and waste disposal.\u00a0 Cross-contamination of equipment and contact surfaces could therefore have happened. \u00a0This was exacerbated by the fact that susceptible cases comprised mainly kidney transplant patients with weakened immune systems, leading to acute infections with extremely high viral quantities in these patients.\u00a0 These patients had many exposures to intravenous medication and tests requiring blood taking.\u00a0 In their report, the IRC concluded that a combination of multiple overlapping factors was the most likely explanation for the HCV outbreak, contained within the 2 renal wards.\nOn 5 December 2015, the IRC\u2019s findings were submitted to MOH, and these findings were made public on 8 December 2015.\nOn 4 April 2016, news was reported that 16 senior staff, 12 from SGH and 4 from MOH, were penalized for their roles in the lapses at SGH.\nThe news reports are available here, here and here, and the IRC report is also publicly available, a copy which we make available here:\nthe-independent-review-committee-report-executive-summary\nThe basis for Terry Xu\u2019s statement\nTerry Xu has not given any indication of the basis for his statement, but The Online Citizen has.\nVia a Facebook post and an article published on 7 October 2019, The Online Citizen defended Terry\u2019s statement:\n\n(See here also)\nTerry has not refuted the contents of The Online Citizen\u2019s post or article.\u00a0 Additionally, he is the Chief Editor of the latter, and has asserted previously that all articles published on The Online Citizen are directed and approved by him (see here). It is reasonable to assume that The Online Citizen\u2019s views are also views that Terry stands by.\nThe crucial paragraphs in The Online Citizen\u2019s post and the article are the following:\n\u201cSo the context of the cover up is about the disclosure of the occurrence of the outbreak.\nUsing the Hep C incident as an example, a whistleblower within the system could have released the information of an unnatural large number of infection happening at SGH to the public or press. It could have been in May where the 8th case was detected or July, where the 20th case was detected.\u201d\n[Emphasis in bold added]\nSo Terry\u2019s statement alleging that there was a cover up of the HCV incident appears to have been based on an opinion \u2013 That by the time the 8th case was detected in May, the public could have been notified, or by July, when the 20th case was detected.\nIt is also important to note that in making this allegation, Terry and The Online Citizen appear to adopt the facts presented in the Independent Review Committee\u2019s report.\u00a0 This is important \u2013 because at least it shows that there is no disagreement with the integrity of the IRC in this regard.\nThere are insufficient grounds to allege a cover up\nAlleging a cover-up is a serious allegation.\u00a0 Accordingly, there must be strong evidence to back up such an allegation, in particular, evidence that a wrongdoer has actively taken steps to conceal their actions.\nAn example of this is the Watergate scandal in the US in 1972, where the US President at the time, Richard Nixon, had attempted to cover up his involvement in having the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters broken into and bugged.\u00a0 FBI investigations discovered a connection between cash found on the men who broke into the DNC headquarters and a fund used by Nixon\u2019s official campaign organization.\u00a0 Later on, and after much resistance from Nixon, tapes from the White House were released which revealed various conversations incriminating Nixon\u2019s involvement in covering up the break-in (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal).\nInterestingly, Wikipedia has a typology about how cover-ups take place, apparently based on famous cover-ups such as the above-mentioned Watergate scandal and Iran-Contra Affair, and we extract this typology below:\n\u201c\u2026 The methods in actual cover-ups tend to follow the general order of the list below.\nInitial response to allegation\n\n\n\n\n\n Flat denial\n Convince the media to bury the story\n Preemptively distribute false information\n Claim that the \u201cproblem\u201d is minimal\n Claim faulty memory\n Claim the accusations are half-truths\n Claim the critic has no proof\n Attack the critic\u2019s motive\n Attack the critic\u2019s character\n\n\n\n\n\nWithhold or tamper with evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n Prevent the discovery of evidence\n Destroy or alter the evidence\n Make discovery of evidence difficult\n Create misleading names of individuals and companies to hide funding\n Lie or commit perjury\n Block or delay investigations\n Issue restraining orders\n Claim executive privilege\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Delayed response to allegation\n\n\n\n\n\n Deny a restricted definition of wrongdoing (e.g. torture)\n Limited hang out (i.e., confess to minor charges)\n Use biased evidence as a defense\n Claim that the critic\u2019s evidence is biased\n Select a biased blue ribbon commission or \u201cindependent\u201d inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Intimidate participants, witnesses or whistleblowers\n\n\n\n\n\n Bribe or buy out the critic\n Generally intimidate the critic by following him or her, killing pets, etc.\n Blackmail: hire private investigators and threaten to reveal past wrongdoing (\u201cdirt\u201d)\n Death threats of the critic or his or her family\n Threaten the critic with loss of job or future employment in industry\n Transfer the critic to an inferior job or location\n Intimidate the critic with lawsuits or SLAPP suits (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation)\n Murder; assassination\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Publicity management\n\n\n\n\n\n Bribe the press\n Secretly plant stories in the press\n Retaliate against hostile media\n Threaten the press with loss of access\n Attack the motives of the press\n Place defensive advertisements\n Buy out the news source\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Damage control\n\n\n\n\n\n Claim no knowledge of wrongdoing\n Scapegoats: blame an underling for unauthorized action\n Fire the person(s) in charge\n\n\n\n\n\nWin court cases\n\n\n\n\n\n Hire the best lawyers\n Hire scientists and expert witnesses who will support your story\n Delay with legal maneuvers\n Influence or control the judges\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Reward cover-up participants\n\n\n\n\n\n Hush money\n Little or no punishment\n Pardon or commute sentences\n Promote employees as a reward for cover-up\n Reemploy the employee after dust clears\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n(See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up)\n\u00a0\nWe should highlight that Terry and The Online Citizen have not raised any of the above issues.\u00a0 The sole issue that forms the basis for the allegation of a cover-up is that the disclosure could have come sooner \u2013 their view.\nYet, if we look at the IRC report, there is an explanation that is reasonable and remains uncontradicted.\nBy end July 2015, it was only SGH that had confirmed 20 cases of HCV infection.\u00a0 The MOH had only been informed on 3 September 2015, and even then, only to the MOH\u2019s Director of Medical Services, who assessed that more information was needed to determine the severity and extent of the outbreak.\u00a0 As found by the IRC, the Minister was only informed of the issue on 18 September 2015, and briefed on 25 September 2015 after the investigation report was submitted the day before.\nThere are 2 crucial paragraphs in the executive summary of the IRC report which merit mention:\n\u201c23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In summary, there was a delay in recognizing the outbreak as HCV is not easily picked up through regular surveillance due to its unique characteristics.\u00a0 With HCV being an unusual HAI [Healthcare-Associated Infection], SGH did not recognize the outbreak in a timely manner. While SGH commenced investigations into the HCV cluster from mid-May, and implemented enhanced infection control measures from early June 2015 onwards which were instrumental in slowing the spread of infection, the IRC is of the view that the outbreak was not investigated and managed optimally.\u00a0 Within MOH, unlike community outbreaks, no one division has clear responsibility to deal with outbreaks of unusual HAIs.\u00a0 This hindered MOH\u2019s ability to respond in a timely way to the unexpected event.\u00a0 In addition, the absence of an established framework for unusual and unfamiliar events resulted in delays in escalating the matter from SGH to SingHealth, from SGH to MOH, and within MOH.\n24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The IRC noted that DMS was only briefed by SGH on 3 September. His key\u00a0considerations then were to make his professional evaluation of the severity and extent of the outbreak, to ascertain that adequate infection control measures had\u00a0indeed been instituted, and to ensure that new transplant patients were not\u00a0potentially exposed to HCV infection until the issues had been adequately addressed. He therefore asked for specific additional investigations and actions to\u00a0be taken in relation to each of these within two weeks, and when these were largely\u00a0done, reported the matter to the Minister. The IRC is of the opinion that the\u00a0additional investigations and actions required by DMS are professionally valid and\u00a0appropriate. Overall, while there were gaps in identification, management and\u00a0reporting of the outbreak, there was no evidence to suggest that escalation to DMS\u00a0and subsequent notification of the Minister had been deliberately delayed.\u201d\nThe above paragraphs are important to point out an additional matter \u2013 The fact that the HCV outbreak was not a usual HAI, and therefore was not part of the system in place in 2015, which was well placed to handle community outbreaks under the Communicable Diseases Division.\u00a0 A community outbreak refers to outbreaks of known infectious diseases, such as Hand Foot and Mouth Disease, Dengue and Malaria.\nSo based on what we have seen and how we understand a cover-up works, the allegation of a cover-up just doesn\u2019t seem to be made out.\n\u00a0\n",
