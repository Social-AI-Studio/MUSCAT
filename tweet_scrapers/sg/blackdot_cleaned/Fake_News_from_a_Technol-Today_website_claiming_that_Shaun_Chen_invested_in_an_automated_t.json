    "Paragraphs": "\n\nOn 27 June 2019, we came across various news articles warning of fake news from a website called \u201cTechnol-Today\u201d.\u00a0 The website purported to carry a Straits Times online article about Mediacorp actor Shaun Chen endorsing an automated trading platform (the \u201cArticle\u201c):\n\nTake note that the Article is false!\n\nThe Straits Times has confirmed that it has not\u00a0published any such news (see the clarification from the Straits Times here).\u00a0 In addition, as pointed out by the Straits Times, none of the links in the Technol-Today article work, instead they are \u2018clickbait\u2019 links directing the reader to another site marketing an automated trading system for trading in \u2018digital currency\u2019 (called Qprofits).\nThe Technol-Today article makes various false claims about the Mediacorp actor, saying in particular, that:-\n\u201cAppearing on the \u2018Toggle Talk\u2019, Shaun Chen discovered an automated trading platform.\u00a0 The idea was simple: allow the average person the opportunity to cash in on the digital currency boom.\u00a0 Even if they have absolutely no investments or technology experience.\u201d\nIt is important to point out that Shaun Chen did give an interview with Toggle Talk, but this was in June 2016! Also that interview had nothing to do with any digital trading or automated trading platform.\nIn the actual interview, Shaun Chen was being interviewed to share his life story and no product was being promoted.\u00a0 Nothing in the Techno-Today article about what allegedly happened during the interview is true (in particular, the interviewer Kate Fang earning some S$283.18 profit in 3 minutes).\u00a0 You can view and read about the actual interview here.\n\nThis is not the first time we have come across fake news being spread by groups purporting to be digital trading companies.\u00a0 There is speculation that such fake news and such groups are not genuinely in the business of digital trading, but are criminal gangs looking to phish information or simply cheat gullible readers into spending money thinking that they are actually trading.\nWe had previously written about such fake news (read our past articles here).\u00a0 It is likely that the authorities are hampered from acting against such sites due to technology reasons (maybe the servers hosting such articles are based overseas, for example), and therefore it seems as though nothing is being done.\u00a0 However, you can arm yourself with better knowledge on such digital currency trading matters and avoid being fooled.\u00a0 Look for a reliable source of financial information (like Seedly) and get answers to your questions before plunging into any financial product.\n",
