    "Paragraphs": "\n\nIntroduction\nOn 5 September 2019, the Media Literacy Council (MLC) published a Facebook post with an infographic that tried to illustrate the different types of fake news one could come across.\n\nThe post generated a significant amount of controversy for classifying clickbait and satire as 2 distinct types of fake news.\u00a0 Many online readers expressed confusion and in a number of cases, anger for the erroneous classification.\u00a0 Social media personality Mr Brown referred to the post and commented, \u201cDear Media Literacy Council, SATIRE is not fake news lah. Please don\u2019t spread this kind of fake news, can? #simisai #simisaialsofakenews\u201d\nOn 8 September 2019, MLC removed the earlier post and replaced it with a response to say that:\n\nThis however, was not enough to stem the online community\u2019s reactions, which generally felt that the responsive post was insufficient and suggestive of attempting to downplay a serious error.\u00a0 At the time we are penning this piece, MLC\u2019s responsive post has received more than 140 reactions, 96 comments and 117 shares.\nVarious commenters gave a cynical take on the responsive post.\u00a0 Just to give a flavour of the sort of online criticism faced by the MLC, the following comments stood out the most:\nA snippet from one said \u201cThis information needs to be correctly contextualised.\u00a0MLC did not merely give \u201cthe wrong impression\u201d \u2013 they propagated fake news and misinformation. The only redeeming factor is that they claimed (after the fact) to not have acted with ill intent or malice. \u2026 As a purveyor of media literacy, they should be fully aware that a takedown of a single post is insufficient \u2013 they should purge all media originated by them of the connected fake information.\u201d\nAnother stated, \u201cI am disappointed at your suggestion that you merely gave the wrong impression \u2013 when you made a false statement. Your mistake \u2013 which I hope was an honest one \u2013 only confirms fears that satire will be seen as fake news \u2013 wittingly or unwittingly. If the MLC does not know the law well enough, how can it presume to educate others on it? What is worse is that despite making a mistake, you chose to explain it away as referring to the context in which fake news can appear, that is, in click-bait and satirical articles. The fact is, false statements can be made even in reputable articles, or anywhere. It\u2019s actually more believable if its written seriously. Instead of admitting the mistake (which Pofma would require), you chose to wave this away as a wrong impression. This is NOT good for your credibility.\u201d\nA relatively new Facebook group, known as \u201cNUSSU \u2013 NUS Students United\u201d said, \u201cShameful! You are blaming us for the wrong impression rather than taking a good look at yourselves for a clear cut false statement of fact. That would be like NTU students saying their kukubird cheers gave the wrong impression and was meant to refer to something innocent. \u00a0Ownself POFMA ownself, please. Thank you very much.\u201d\nAnother reader stated, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the wrong impression. It was clear what the infographic showed. Please retract the insinuation that Satire is fake news when it is clearly not. If the supposed educator cannot discern the difference then what moral authority do they have to educate?\u201d\nWhy so angry?\n1. The (excessive) focus on POFMA.\n\u00a0A lot of the online rage seems to be focused on \u201cdefending\u201d the genre of satire from falling into a category that is prosecuted under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill (POFMA).\nPOFMA came into force on 28 June this year, after having been passed by Parliament on 8 May 2019 and given the President\u2019s assent on 3 June 2019.\nMany will recall that, when the bill was debated, not a small amount of concern was raised over how the menace of \u201cfake news\u201d ought to be defined.\u00a0 One of the reassurances given by the Minister for Home Affairs and Law, Mr K Shanmugam, was that satire was explicitly not a target of POFMA.\u00a0 In an interview with CNA in 13 April 2019, the Minister had said:\n\u201cTherefore, ministers are proposed to be given the power. Is it false? And if it\u2019s false, you move in immediately to say: Clarify this. This is not true, it\u2019s false. But we are only talking about facts, not opinion, not satire, not parody, not comments. Direct allegations \u2013 did a rape take place? Was this said or was it not said about a mosque by this person. Direct factual allegations which have impact on the public. Ministers call that and you put out a clarification, together with the original article, except that in some cases the original article may have to be taken down.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n(Read more here)\nSo, to many who equate the MLC with the government, that 5 September post indicating that satire and clickbait were types of fake news must have sent out alarm bells because it seemed that the government was contradicting itself about POFMA.\nWe will talk more about this later.\nFor now, let\u2019s be clear about one thing \u2013 POFMA is a law that targets only some specific types of fake news.\u00a0 Not all of them.\u00a0 Specifically, the sort of fake news that is targeted are firstly, false statements of fact that are also:\n\nPrejudicial to the security of Singapore (whether in whole or in part), or public health, safety, tranquillity or finances;\nPrejudicial to the friendly relations of Singapore with other countries;\nInfluence the outcome of an election to certain public offices or a referendum;\nIncites feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between groups;\nDiminishes confidence in the government or some public function of Singapore.\n\n(See section 7 of POFMA)\nThe above is literally a small aspect within the entire world that makes up the term \u201cfake news\u201d.\u00a0 Many aspects of fake news do not actually fall for consideration under POFMA.\u00a0 Take for example, if a mischievous individual were to spread a Facebook post saying:\n\u201cSingapore will be expanding Gardens By The Bay and construction has started on a mini-Gardens By The Bay in Orchard Road, set to open in 2020\u201d\nThe above is clearly untrue but would probably not be fake news that falls to be prosecuted under POFMA.\nAs one of the few factchecking agencies in Singapore, we can\u2019t stress enough how much POFMA has changed perceptions on \u201cfake news\u201d.\u00a0 Writers and readers have reacted with concern at some of our articles to query whether we are saying that a crime under POFMA has been committed.\u00a0 There is a live concern that POFMA is so powerful and all-encompassing a law that anything untrue would likely fall for prosecution.\nAs much as we keep clarifying this, we cannot prevent people out there having the misconception that POFMA is here to catch all forms of fake news.\n2. Factcheckers grapple with how to deal with satire.\nWhat is satire?\nIn A Glossary of Literary Terms (7th Edition), M.H. Abrams, 1999, Cornell University, Heinle & Heinle (access the entire publication here), the author describes \u201csatire\u201d as:-\n\u201cSatire can be described as the literary art of diminishing or derogating a subject by making it ridiculous and evoking towards it attitudes of amusement, contempt, scorn, or indignation. It differs from the comic in that comedy evokes laughter mainly as an end in itself, while satire derides; that is, it uses laughter as a weapon, and against a butt that exists outside the work itself.\u201d\n[Emphases in bold added by us]\n(Get the full title here)\nNow this also means that an important component of recognisable satire is humorous exaggeration.\u00a0 A piece of real life is taken and stretched until it is entirely blown out of proportion, so ridiculous in nature that one laughs and goes \u201cOk, that can\u2019t be real\u201d.\nThis fundamental criteria is also why we include in our ratings for satirical posts, the image of a jester:\n\nIt is unhelpful to give something a label of \u201csatire\u201d, or worse, hope that it is seen as satire, when it fails to meet the standard of being humorous exaggeration.\u00a0 It can get difficult for us to regard something as satirical because look, successful satire has got to be funny.\u00a0 If it isn\u2019t funny, what an author aimed to write as a piece of satire then fails to be satire, even though he genuinely hoped for it to be satirical.\nNow let\u2019s look at \u201cfake news\u201d.\u00a0 Consider: How does \u201csatire\u201d fit into the different categories which constitute \u201cfake news\u201d?\nKeep in mind that there is no universally accepted definition on what constitutes \u201cfake news\u201d.\u00a0 Singapore in particular has some confusion between \u201cPOFMA fake news\u201d and other forms of fake news.\nIn an article published by First Draft, a journalist-support organisation in the USA, \u201cfake news\u201d and what it comprised was illustrated as follows:\n\n(see the article here)\nYou can see that satire or parody is indicated as a type of misinformation or disinformation that has \u201cno intention to cause harm but has potential to fool\u201d.\nFactcheckers themselves have differing ways of rating truth and falsity where it comes to satire. \u00a0While popular US website \u201cSnopes\u201d has the following definition,\n\nPulitzer prize winning factchecker \u201cPolitifact\u201d has no separate category for satire and in fact continues to rate satire as false (for some factchecks in fact, they use their rating \u201cPants on Fire!\u201d, which appears to be reserved for the worst kind of falsehoods).\n\nTo be very clear, we are not saying that either website\u2019s particular approach is ideal.\u00a0 In fact, we regard Snopes\u2019 definition of \u201cLabeled Satire\u201d as unhelpful because the details of the rating do not make it clear whether something is truly satire or not, and if not, what it then actually is.\u00a0 So let\u2019s take an example \u2013 A purveyor of fake news decides to get out of trouble by making a post on Facebook declaring:\n\u201cHey everyone, please note that all my posts are SATIRICAL.\u00a0 If you believe them, that\u2019s your own problem!\u201d\n(By the way, at the time of our writing, it seems that Rice media is suggesting this in a satirical piece.)\nUnder the Snopes system, every previous post by the author would technically have to be rated as \u201cLabeled Satire\u201d.\u00a0 Similarly, under the Politifact system, every piece by the rogue purveyor would be labelled as a falsehood.\nThis doesn\u2019t help the online community as fully as it should. \u00a0An online reader would reasonably expect to be informed as to whether something is truly satire or not.\u00a0 Hence it is worth pondering why both Snopes and Politifact, being excellent factchecking sites, have differing views and potentially incomplete solutions to the category of \u2018satire\u2019.\n3. Satire is not just a \u2018genre\u2019. It is also a standard of writing, and bad satire has consequences.\nIt just isn\u2019t good enough to point out that your piece is satirical.\u00a0 Your piece has got to be good enough to be satirical.\nJust take a look at a few good examples of satire from the following satirical websites:\n\nThe New Nation (Singapore)\n\n\n\nSingapore Policy Diary (Singapore)\n\n\n\nThe Onion (USA website)\n\n\nNow take a look at (in our opinion), poor examples of satire:\n\nNew Nation\u2019s piece on the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s will:\n\n\nComment: Based on the article and the comments we read, the serious nature of the topic and the little humour within the article did lead a number of readers to think that the New Nation article was genuine.\n\nThe Onion\u2019s piece on Osama Bin Laden:\n\n\nComment: The Onion\u2019s satire piece was reproduced on Yahoo news without any indication that it was satire.\u00a0 In addition, we assessed that the comedic nuances in the article were related to US culture and local Singapore readers may not have caught on to the comedic references.\u00a0 See our factcheck here.\nAre there consequences to bad satire?\nYes there are.\nIn February 2014, the New Nation published a satirical piece titled \u201cPM Lee unfriends Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Facebook, untags him from photos\u201d (see here).\u00a0 It poked fun at the roller-coaster state of Singapore-Indonesia relations at the time due to the Indonesian military choosing to name a new Indonesian Navy vessel as \u201cUsman Harun\u201d \u2013 which was the name of an Indonesian commando saboteur who committed terrorist bombings in Singapore and was subsequently arrested, tried and executed in a Singapore Court (see a report on the incident here).\nThe satirical article suggested that given that some parts of the relationship between both countries were warm and some parts were facing problems, the strongest response that could be given was the passive-aggressive act of the Singapore Prime Minister unfriending the then-Indonesian President on Facebook.\nUnfortunately, the New Nation\u2019s article was widely carried on Indonesian news agency Tribunnews.com as a genuine report on 11 February 2014 (see here).\u00a0 It was only discovered subsequently by the Indonesian paper that the satirical article did not contain facts, and 2 days later, on 13 February 2014, a correction piece withdrawing the earlier article was published (see here).\nNotably, in the correction piece, there was no reference to the word \u201csatire\u201d (we are unclear if there is a conveniently equivalent term in the Indonesian language), and the translated title page states:\n\u201cTRIBUNNEWS.COM , JAKARTA \u2013 News about the Prime Minister of Singapore removing friendships with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Facebook , which is already widely circulated, it turns out hoaxes, false news.\u201d\nSo maybe, if there is even a risk that a written work won\u2019t be regarded as satire, perhaps the author should label his post from the outset.\nThis would demonstrate an intention to be understood in the proper light \u2013 At the very least, it states clearly that it isn\u2019t factual.\nBefore you think that this is a ridiculous suggestion, take note that the satirical website \u201cSingapore Policy Diary\u201d and \u201cNew Nation\u201d do actually take steps to make clear that their work is intended as satire and not to be believed:\n\n\n4. Factchecking deals with symptoms. Being a discerning reader is the cure against believing fake news\nIdeally, everyone should be able to assess online material the same way the Rappler did.\u00a0 Rappler is an online publication in the Philippines, and it had to deal with this precise issue of identifying what was a misleading falsehood from a piece of satire.\nIn short, a website known as the \u201cAdobo Chronicles\u201d had published a story claiming that then-vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo had said she would immediately resign if she got elected alongside Duterte, now the president of the Philippines.\u00a0 This was entirely untrue \u2013 but Adobo Chronicles considers itself a satirical website.\u00a0 Rappler pointed out that many of Duterte\u2019s fans in the Philippines were not aware that this was satire.\u00a0 Read the article here.\nIn pointing out that the Adobo Chronicles was unacceptable fake news and not satire, Rappler pointed out, amongst other things, that:\n\u201cTrue satire pieces do not stoop down to explaining to its readers which parts are made up and which aren\u2019t. Satire is meant to be read unencumbered by clues, much less spoonfeeding by way of font changes and a warning flash of red and green. It\u2019s supposed to spark the reader\u2019s critical thinking and not hamper it. (It also goes without saying that constantly being reminded which sentence is or isn\u2019t factual is a jarring, bizarre experience that does not make for decent reading.)\u201d\nBut to know true satire from poor satire, one must be able to discern satire from fake news.\u00a0 Perhaps it is then opportune for us to consider what is the role of the MLC.\n\u00a0The MLC describes themselves as:\n\u201c\u2026a group of members from the people, private and public sectors.\u00a0 The MLC spearheads public education on media literacy and cyber wellness, and advises the government on appropriate policy responses to the evolving world of media, technology and consumer participation.\u201d\nAnd their goal?\n\u201cIn today\u2019s digital and social media landscape, the Council seeks to address problems such as cyber safety and security, discernment of online falsehoods, cyber bullying and uncivil online behaviour.\u00a0 Its role is to cultivate digital users\u2019 critical-thinking skills and refine their understanding of the issues in the online world so as to empower tme to be safe, smart, and kind online.\u201d\nIn short, the MLC is not an enforcer of POFMA.\nThe MLC is also not a standard setter on what constitutes satire, or definer of what constitutes \u201cfake news\u201d.\u00a0 It only tries to help digital users develop the critical thinking skills to digest online media holistically.\nWe do not envy the role of the MLC, which is broad and subject to criticism from all corners of the web.\nWhen we look at the 5 September post by the MLC that has led to the entire debate, one question that lingers is whether MLC\u2019s true error is not so much that it had conflated satire and clickbait as part of the overall umbrella of \u201cfake news\u201d but rather, that it had chosen to take the \u2018safer\u2019 approach to urge online readers to treat satire with scepticism.\u00a0 It is the safer approach because indeed, satire, poorly done, has the potential to become fake news.\u00a0 This is indisputable.\u00a0 Likewise, clickbait, while in and of itself cannot be said to be fake news, similarly has the potential to become fake news.\n5. Should we expect a higher standard of writing or reading for the online community?\nIn our view, as technology progresses and enables individuals to broadcast their opinions to everyone, it is not unreasonable to expect writing or reading standards to progress equally.\nAchieving the latter is however, difficult.\nAs we have repeated before \u2013 Everyone writes with a purpose.\u00a0 A purpose to persuade the reader.\u00a0 However, even if we exclude those that write with nefarious purposes, not every online writer, journalist (whatever one chooses to call himself/herself) has the ability to write succinctly and clearly \u2013 This includes framing one\u2019s statements as clearly as possible to avoid misinterpretation and propagating a falsehood, whether intentionally or unintentionally.\nIt is perhaps much easier (and much less explored) for us to focus on warning readers of pitfalls in reading information online.\u00a0 This could well take the form of:-\n\nAlerting readers to sources rather than types of fake news;\nConsidering the various possible interpretations of unclear statements, whether of fact or opinion;\nHaving the patience to await responses, so that a fuller understanding of the online piece can be given.\n\nHence, when we saw Joshua Ip\u2019s unhesitant criticism of the MLC:\n\nJoshua Ip could equally have asked:-\n\nWhether MLC was admitting \u201cwrongdoing\u201d. A mistaken view is surely different from a malicious defamation.\nWhether it was entirely incorrect to say that satire is fake news \u2013 After all, satire could be a source of fake news.\nWhether it is fair to allege that the MLC sought to propagate fake news and misinformation, since in the same passage, he seems to accept that MLC did not act with ill intent or malice (and what this ill intent or malice is, is not specified).\n\nSo the shoe can equally be placed on the other foot \u2013 as online community members, we should each be able to effectively convey what we intended to convey, and where there is a doubt as to the original meaning and intention of a post, sometimes a simple clarification is all that is required to convey one\u2019s meaning fully.\n\u00a0\nIn short, we all could do better.\n",
