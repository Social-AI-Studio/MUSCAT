    "Paragraphs": "\nThe iPhone 13 is officially being released in Singapore on 24 September, and we coincidentally came across a post on Facebook which might (initially) send waves of panic through those who have pre-ordered it:\n\nThe caption in the photo urges individuals not to buy the new iPhone 13 because while the \u201cfirst iPhone took 2007 years to produce\u201d, the newest edition was \u201cdeveloped in just one short year\u201d. It then claims that \u201creliable sources\u201d have revealed that there is a data chip in the phone that can \u201ctrack your exact position\u201d.\nPutting the ridiculousness of the claim that the first iPhone took 2007 years to produce aside, we did a search on Facebook of the terms \u201cplease do not buy this new iPhone 13\u201d and found several other posts by various individuals who have posted the same text.\nIt is important to note that commenters on the post have caught onto the sheer absurdity of claim, with a large majority of them reacting with the \u2018laughing\u2019 emoticon, or commenting as such:\n\n\n\n\nWe also came across another photo which makes the same claim. However, the word \u201csatire\u201d can be seen written at the bottom right of the graphic:\n\nWhile the verdict of the claims made quite tellingly points to them being an act of satire, let\u2019s still quickly go through the facts:\n\nIt is true that the first ever iPhone came out in the year 2007\nIt is true that the predecessor of the iPhone 13, the iPhone 12, was launched one year ago in 2020\nIt is true that smartphones are able to identify its users\u2019 location \u2013 this is also why you are able to use the GPS/Maps function on your phone. However, Android and Apple users are also able to choose which apps are able to access and use one\u2019s location and when\n\nIn conclusion, this is a clear example of satire.\n\n",
