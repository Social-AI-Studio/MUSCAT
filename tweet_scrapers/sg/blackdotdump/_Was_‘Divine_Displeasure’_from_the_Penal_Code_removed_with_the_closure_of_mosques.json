    "Paragraphs": "\nWe have been alerted to a comment posted on Ustaz Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir\u2019s Instagram post dated 5 June.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dear Muslims, .  Mosques have just been reopened this week for individual prayer. With Allah's grace and help and a much improved situation, we can return to jemaah and Jumaat prayers when it is safe to do so. . For now, please continue to perform Zuhur at home and watch the online khutbah. There will be NO Jumaat prayers in mosques. . Stay safe and cool on such a cool Friday morning. . (Nak ingatkan aje, takut ada yang ke masjid nak solat Jumaat. Pak Imam tak sembunyi \u2013 cuma menantikan masa yang sesuai dan selamat Insha-Allah. Sabar ye!) . Wassalamu'alaikum wa rahmatullah.\nA post shared by  Nazirudin Nasir (@nazirudinmnasir) on Jun 4, 2020 at 8:00pm PDT\n\n\n\nDr Nazirudin is the current Mufti appointed at the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS).\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of the comment on his post:\n\u00a0\n\nThe comment translates to:\n\u201cHas anyone noticed? When mosques were closed, the section on \u201cDivine Displeasure\u201d was removed from Chapter 224 (Penal Code)\u201d.\nOn 12 Mar, MUIS announced that all 70 mosques in Singapore would be closed for at least five days for cleaning and disinfection in a bid to help curb the spread of COVID-19.\nFour days later, MUIS announced an extension of the closure after contact tracing revealed that five infected individuals had visited at least 10 mosques in Singapore. On 24 Mar, MUIS announced that mosques would be closed \u201cuntil further notice amid a heightened risk of COVID-19 transmission in the community\u201d.\nSince then, mosques across Singapore have remained closed.\nWhat is the section on \u201cDivine Displeasure\u201d?\n\u201cDivine Displeasure\u201d is found under Section 508 of the Penal Code, and is a law that has been in place since Singapore\u2019s first Penal Code which started in 1872.\nThere isn\u2019t a whole lot of information about what it entails, but according to an article on The Straits Times on little known laws in Singapore, it makes it illegal for someone to \u201ccause or attempt to cause any person to do anything that he is not legally bound to do, or to not do anything which he is legally bound to do, by inducing that person to believe he or someone close to him will become \u2018an object of divine displeasure\u2019 if he does not listen to you\u201d.\nEssentially, it is illegal to trick someone into thinking that he would be \u201ccursed or make divine beings unhappy\u201d if he did not obey you.\nGoing back to the claim made by the individual who commented on Ustaz Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir\u2019s Instagram post, we did a quick check on the most updated version of the Penal Code and while it is indeed true that Section 508 on \u201cDivine Displeasure\u201d has been removed, it was repealed by Act 15 of 2019, with effect from 1 Jan 2020.\nThe Criminal Law Reform Act 2019, which was read the first time on 11 Feb 2019, had repealed Section 508 on grounds that \u201cit is no longer relevant in today\u2019s context\u201d.\nGiven that Section 508 has been repealed since 1 Jan 2020, we rate the claim that the removal of it from the Penal Code ties in to the closure of mosques due to COVID-19 as false.\n\n",
