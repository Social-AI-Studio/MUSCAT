Since each exhibition hall at Singapore Expo can accommodate 480 patients, it is estimated at around 960 migrant workers in the two exhibition halls have been affected. The authorities have already vaccinated around 75% of these individuals. There are currently no other migrant workers who are experiencing symptoms of chicken pox.\u201d\nThe post has been shared over 970 times at time of publication.\nIf the claims are to be believed, the incident happened at the Singapore Expo and MAX Atria community isolation facility, which has been operational since 10 April.\nThen, Health Minister Mr Gan Kim Yong shared that the facility will initially have one hall catering to about 480 patients, but will \u201cprogressively expand\u201d as demand goes up and number of cases increase. The facility houses two types of COVID-19 patients \u2013 recovering patients and \u201cearly patients\u201d.\n3 recovered, 1 still in hospital\nAccording to an article on Lianhe Zaobao, the Woodlands Health Campus team, which is responsible for medical services at Singapore Expo, confirmed that four patients have indeed contracted chicken pox, and were transferred to a public hospital for treatment. Three of them have since recovered, and one is still in the hospital.\nThe patients began to develop chicken pox from 27 April to 16 May. 75% of those staying at the facility (around 960 individuals) were later vaccinated against chicken pox.\nThe team added that currently, no other patients have symptoms of chicken pox, and that the medical team will \u201cconduct more active health monitoring in the future\u201d.\nThus, the claim that four foreign workers at Singapore Expo have contracted chicken pox and that 960 have been exposed to it is true.\n\n",
