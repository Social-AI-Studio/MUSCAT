    "Paragraphs": "\nSingapore Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced on 8 April (Thursday) he is stepping aside as leader of the ruling People\u2019s Action Party\u2019s 4th generation (4G) team. The unexpected move raises questions as to who would eventually take the top job as the city-state\u2019s next prime minister.\nIn our poll to assess Singaporeans\u2019 sentiments to the news, 60% of respondents indicated a lack of confidence in next generation ministers to lead the country. And, while Mr Heng had suggested a younger candidate would be more suitable to succeed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, only 3% of respondents picked youth as a must-have trait.\n\n",
