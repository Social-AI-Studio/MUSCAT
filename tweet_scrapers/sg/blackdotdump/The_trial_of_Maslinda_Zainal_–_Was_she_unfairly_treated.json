    "Paragraphs": "\n\nRecently, we saw a post by the website \u201cRilek1Corner\u201d claiming the following (the \u201cPost\u201c):\n\nWe understand the Post to be drawing a comparison between the ongoing criminal trial of teacher Maslinda Zainal, the former Head of Department for English language in Singapore\u2019s Woodgrove Secondary School, and the sensational 2015 trial and subsequent appeal of Kong Hee, the former president and pastor of City Harvest Church.\nMaslinda Zainal was reported on 28 November 2018 as having been charged with 2 counts of Criminal Breach of Trust for misappropriating more than S$40,000 which she had collected from students of Woodgrove Secondary School.\u00a0 Maslinda had originally been tasked to collect money from students to purchase learning packages called the \u201cExcel package\u201d.\u00a0 According to various reports, the money was supposed to be handed to the school\u2019s bookshop owner, but Maslinda had given only a portion and kept over S$40,000 (See reports here, here and here).\nKong Hee was convicted on 20 November 2015 together with 5 other senior members of the City Harvest Church of misappropriating S$24 million in church funds, and another S$26 million to cover up the misuse of funds.\u00a0 The S$24 million in funds were misused in order to fund the singing career of Kong Hee\u2019s wife, Ho Yeow Sun (see Straits Times report here).\u00a0 The 6 convicted subsequently made a successful appeal against their sentence in 2018, and saw significant reduction in their sentences.\u00a0 While Kong Hee had originally been sentenced to 8 years in jail, his sentence was reduced on appeal to 3 years and 6 months in jail.\nThe Post may be Misleading and incorrect\n\nWe note that the meme contained within the Post may suggest that Maslinda has been unfairly treated and been sentenced to life imprisonment.\u00a0 Also, that she was being forced to give a confession to the Court. Such suggestions would be misleading and incorrect.\n\u2013 Maslinda Zainal is presently arguing that she has been unfairly treated by the police and Ministry of Education investigators and not the Court.\n\u2013 Maslinda Zainal has not been sentenced to a life sentence for committing breach of trust.\u00a0 She has yet to be convicted and cannot be sentenced as yet.\n\u2013 The comparison with the case of Kong Hee is incorrect because Kong Hee\u2019s case has already concluded with a conviction and sentencing has taken place.\u00a0 Maslinda\u2019s trial is ongoing.\nWhere did the Post get those statements from?\nThe Post arose due to the recent reports on the ongoing trial of Maslinda Zainal.\u00a0 See here.\nThe source of the statement claiming that \u201c40k gets life imprisonment\u201d comes from what Maslinda said while being examined in Court.\u00a0 At this stage, Maslinda is arguing that her statements given to the police and Ministry of Education investigators were given involuntarily because of the alleged duress placed on her during the investigations.\u00a0 She is not saying that she has received such a sentence.\nSee this part of the CNA news article referenced above:\n\u201cShe claimed that a police officer, Station Inspector Navindeer Singh, accused her of taking about S$300,000. He came to this figure by multiplying S$20,000 \u2013 the approximate figure for each of her two charges \u2013 by 15 years, the total time she had been at the school.\n\u201cI told him that I did not do such a thing and I broke down and cried very, very badly,\u201d said Maslinda. \u201cHe then threatened me. He said \u2013 as a civil servant, when you\u2019re charged with criminal breach of trust, are you aware that you\u2019re facing a life sentence, you will never see your family ever again.\u201d\nShe also did say that she was forced to admit things that she didn\u2019t do \u2013 see here.\nBut keep in mind that the trial is ongoing, and what Maslinda has said is being assessed by the Court to see if she had\u00a0been illegally pressured to admit to the crimes.\nMaslinda is not being handed any life sentence.\u00a0 She is also not presently being forced to admit anything in Court, and the trial continues to be ongoing.\nAbout Maslinda Zainal\u2019s charges\nWhat we know so far is that Maslinda has been charged with Criminal Breach of Trust (CBT).\u00a0 This itself is not entirely clear.\u00a0 There are several different types of CBT offences, each carrying different possible sentences.\u00a0 The simplest form of\u00a0 CBT is section 406 of the Penal Code, which carries the maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment:-\n406.\u00a0\u00a0Whoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with both.\nHowever, as Maslinda is a teacher with the Ministry of Education, she may fall under the definition of a public servant (depending on what the nature of her specific employment is), so it is possible that she has been charged with the most serious version of the CBT offence, which is section 409 of the Penal Code:-\n409.\u00a0\u00a0Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over property, in his capacity of a public servant, or in the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent, commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine.\nNote however, that just because the offence carries a possible maximum sentence of life imprisonment, this does not mean that, if convicted, Maslinda will be handed such a sentence.\u00a0 The Courts consider a variety of matters in determining the appropriate sentence, and it remains to be seen what (if any) sentence will be handed down eventually.\n",
