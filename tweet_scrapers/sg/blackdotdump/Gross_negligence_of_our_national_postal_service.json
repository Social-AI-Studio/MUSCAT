    "Paragraphs": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you be surprised to find out that the national postal service could be grossly negligent in running a flyer distribution business?\nWe were too. Which is why we had to do a fact-check on this article regarding Singapore Post Limited (\u201cSingPost\u201d).\nThe story is true.\n\nA massage parlour business in Singapore paid for SingPost to deliver flyers. The business owner later discovered that SingPost failed to deliver the flyers, and complained. SingPost launched an initial investigation and reported back that the business owner was wrong, and that the flyers were delivered \u2013 SingPost submitted photos of the flyers in mailboxes as proof.\nThe business owner discovered that the photos from SingPost\u2019s investigation were fake.\nSingPost has since apparently apologised and refunded the business owner.\nWe wrote to Singapore Post via Facebook Messenger to ask for their views. We asked for confirmation of the story, in particular, that they had apologised to the business owner. They have chosen not to respond.\nWe treat the news as reliable given that there are 2 independent sources who have verified their news with the direct sources of this report (Lianhe Wanbao and Mothership)\nSee the Chinese news version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
