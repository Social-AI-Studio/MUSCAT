    "Paragraphs": "\n\n\nWe came across a video of a rat scurrying about in a Din Tai Fung restaurant outlet kitchen.\nOn Whatsapp and social media, many have queried whether this took place in Singapore. It did NOT. The incident happened at an outlet of Din Tai Fung in Sydney, Australia. Multiple reports of this incident have been published in the Australian news here, here and here.\n\nThe outlet in Australia has been temporarily shut pending pest control operations and checks by the authorities. We understand that a statement has also been issued by Din Tai Fung Australia to a news organisation in Australia, and reports of the statement have been shared in the news.\n",
