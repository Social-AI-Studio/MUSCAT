    "Paragraphs": "\n\nYou may have come across this article published in the Straits Times on 19 April 2019, discussing the reactions to the following advertisement:\n\n(scroll to 4:39 to see the incriminating scene \u2013 \u201cTank Man\u201d is reflected in the lens)\nLeica is facing criticism in China for creating the advertisement, which appears intended as a moving tribute to photojournalists but carrying the underlying message that great photojournalists used Leica cameras.\u00a0 Unfortunately for Leica, the advertisement featured a photojournalist taking the iconic \u201cTank Man\u201d picture of the Tiananmen Square, and this appears to be the trigger event for the criticism (See here).\nThe iconic image known as \u201cTank Man\u201d (see below) has, for a long time now, been a poignant symbol of the sacrifice behind the horrific Tiananmen incident in 1989.\u00a0 It is also a sensitive image that riles the Chinese government.\nPublished by The Associated Press, originally photographed by Jeff Widener, Fair use, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=239713\nIt has been reported that Leica now denies having \u2018sanctioned\u2019 the advertisement.\u00a0 F/Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi, the company which created the advertisement refutes the denial, saying that it was indeed commissioned and authorised to release the advertisement.\nWe can\u2019t tell who\u2019s right or wrong here, but one thing caught our eye \u2013 Petapixel\u2019s article, claiming that the \u201cTank Man\u201d shot wasn\u2019t even taken by Leica.\u00a0 INSTEAD, ALL THE PHOTOS OF TANK MAN OR SIMILAR TO TANK MAN WERE TAKEN WITH NIKON CAMERAS.\nThis article is about Petapixel\u2019s claim.\u00a0\u00a0Were all the \u201cTank Man\u201d pictures taken with Nikon cameras?\n\nWe think it is likely true!\nWhat we managed to find\nSo the basis for the Petapixel article is a German publication known as Spiegel Online.\u00a0 Spiegel published this article, claiming that:\n\u201cNone of the photographers used a Leica camera at the time, as the film suggests.\u00a0Instead, Jeff Widener (AP), Charlie Cole (Newsweek), Stuart Franklin (Magnum) and Arthur Tsang (Reuters) were working with cameras from Japanese competitor Nikon, as they confirmed on request.\u00a0Widener, Cole and Franklin also stated that they had not been contacted by Leica or the company\u2019s advertising agency.\u201c\n[Emphasis in bold added]\nWe decided to test out Spiegel\u2019s claims by running our own searches to see what we could uncover.\u00a0 Spiegel claimed to have admissions by each photographer, but would these admissions be contradicted?\nPerhaps the most authoritative article we found was a 2009 New York Times article here.\u00a0 Given the age of the article (published in 2009) and the facts inside the article almost entirely corroborate with Spiegel\u2019s claims, we are inclined to say that the Petapixel story is probably true.\nAccording to the NY Times, Jeff Widener used a Nikon F3 Titanium model:\n\u201cA stray rock had struck my face while photographing a burning armored car during the Tiananmen uprising. The Nikon F3 Titanium camera had had absorbed the shock and thus saved my life.\u201d\nIn the same article, Arthur Tsang Hin Wah said:\n\u201cAt around noon. we heard the roar of tanks. More than 20 of them, in a big column, pulled out from the square and came our way. I loaded my Nikon F3HP with film and started shooting with a 300mm telephoto lens.\u201c\nAs for Charlie Cole, the World Press Photo states specifically that he used a Nikon FM2 camera.\u00a0 See here.\nThe only one we could not verify was Stuart Franklin\u2019s camera \u2013 There is absolutely no information we could find on what he used, whether Leica or Nikon.\u00a0 Seeing that Spiegel\u2019s claim on this is undisputed, it is probably true that\u00a0he used a Nikon.\nPurely based on logic, one should know that Leica is a camera brand that places itself in a premium, pedigree category and prices itself that way as well.\u00a0 Today, Leica has a reputation of being a popular camera to collect rather than use.\u00a0 Nikon has a completely different reputation, and better identifies itself as a hardy, workhorse camera, chosen by professional sports, nature and photojournalism photographers alike.\u00a0 It is for this reason that Stuart Franklin was more likely to have used a Nikon rather than a Leica to snap his version of the \u201cTank Man\u201d photo.\nLet\u2019s not forget that every one of his colleagues who had also taken the \u201cTank Man\u201d picture used a Nikon.\nSo probably, Leica never had a role in the eventual \u201cTank Man\u201d picture.\nGood thing they disown this advertisement ;-P\n",
