    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this post on Facebook:\n\nThe author of post shares several images of individuals with black patches on various parts of their skin.\nAlong with the photos the author writes that this is \u201cIndia\u2019s new virus mutant\u201d and expresses his hopes that \u201cthey didn\u2019t bring this into our Nation too\u201d. Given the context (and also the Facebook group that it was shared in), it can be deduced that \u201cthey\u201d refers to Indian nationals who have travelled to Singapore.\nMore about the infection dubbed the \u2018black fungus\u2019\nOne of the earliest reports of the infection dubbed the \u2018black fungus\u2019 affecting individuals in India was published on 9 May 2021 on BBC. In the report, we read that doctors in India have been reporting a rise in cases involving a rare infection called mucormycosis (aka \u2018black fungus\u2019) among recovering and recovered COVID-19 patients. In a more recent article on the condition by Scientific American, we read that there have been almost 12,000 cases of the infection in India in recent months.\nBelow is a quick explainer video of mucormycosis on The Straits Times\u2019 Youtube channel:\n\nMucormycosis is caused by exposure to a group of moulds called mucormycetes. These fungi are commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables. It affects the sinuses, the brain and the lungs.\nAccording to the Indian Health Ministry, it \u201cbegins to manifest as skin infection in the air pockets located behind our forehead, nose, cheekbones, and in between the eyes and teeth\u201d and then \u201ceyes, lungs and can even spread to the brain\u201d. It then leads to blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing of blood. Mucormycosis has a mortality rate of 54%.\nAccording to the CDC, people get\u00a0mucormycosis by coming in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. For example, the lung or sinus forms of the infection can occur after someone breathes in spores. Mucormycosis can also develop on the skin after the fungus enters the skin through a cut, scrape, burn, or other type of skin trauma.\nDoctors and experts believe that the condition may be triggered by unsanitary conditions and also the use of high doses of corticosteroids, used as a life-saving treatment for severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. These steroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that damp down the immune system\u2019s overreaction to infection, but also make a patient \u201cmore vulnerable to attack by whatever bacteria or fungi are already in their body or hanging around their environment\u201d.\nHowever, mucormycosis is not contagious and does not spread from person to person.\nTherefore, the insinuation that Indian nationals coming into Singapore might be infected with mucormycosis/\u2019black fungus\u2019 and that this is cause for concern for Singaporeans is wrong. Given that mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that has been in existence way before COVID-19, the claim that it is a \u201cnew virus mutant\u201d is also categorically false.\n\n",
