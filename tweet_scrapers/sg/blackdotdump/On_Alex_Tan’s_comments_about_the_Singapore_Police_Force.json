    "Paragraphs": "\n\nOn 28 May 2019, We came across a published post titled \u201cSingapore Police and government incompetent of exercising wisdom\u201c.\n\nWe regard the above post as misleading as it appears to stretch or distort various facts.\n\nThe post claims that:-\n\nIn recent cases involving molest and voyeurism, the Singapore Police had told Singaporeans to accept such crimes as petty crimes that warrant a warning with no repercussions.\nThe NUS victim had no recourse against the police\u2019s decision except to pressure the university for harsher penalties.\nIn cases where a stern warning would suffice, the Singapore police kicked up a storm.\u00a0 2 examples were cited:- 2 Singaporeans arrested for posting a comment on Facebook saying they wanted to egg Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Law and Home Affairs.\u00a0 And, a Singaporean was fined S$300 for flicking a piece of rubber band on the road.\n\nWe point out where the untruths are in each statement above.\nOn the Crimes Relating to Voyeurism and Molest\nVoyeurism and molest are not taken lightly.\u00a0 As of 6 May 2019, the Penal Code has been amended to make voyeurism acts (such as taking upskirt photos) specific crimes and also enhanced punishments for insult of modesty.\u00a0 In addition, the Penal Code has also been amended so that cyber sexual exposure, deception or misrepresentation in sexual activity, sexual exploitation of persons between 16-18 years old and other new types of offences involving minors/vulnerable victims have been enhanced.\u00a0 These enhancements are important \u2013 They give the Singapore Police new powers to tackle and intervene in situations where the police and the AGC previously had to take extra time and effort to ensure that they had the power to intervene before doing so.\nRead about the amendments to the law here and here.\nIt is important to highlight that these changes have been made to the Penal Code after an extensive period of review of the state of crime in Singapore and intensive consultation with concerned agencies in Singapore.\u00a0 See the report of the Penal Code Review Committee in August 2018 here.\nEven ignoring the above amendments in May 2019, the Singapore Police Force have also never told Singaporeans to accept molest and voyeurism as petty crimes.\u00a0 The Police (and indeed the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers) have repeatedly mentioned that in deciding whether to prosecute or not, they consider both\u00a0deterrence and\u00a0rehabilitation.\u00a0 If the circumstances are sufficiently mitigating,\u00a0rehabilitation is preferred to give the offender a chance to change.\nWe repost the Police Media Statement issued on 23 April 2019 (we had previously posted this in our factcheck on the Monica Baey incident, described further below):\n\nA Conditional Warning is NOT a warning with no repercussions.\u00a0 In every single one of the media reports regarding suspects who have received warnings, these were conditional warnings.\u00a0 In other words, the perpetrator has to stay clear of all crime in the next 12 months, otherwise the suspect\u00a0will be charged with the original offence and the new offence.\nAs for the reference to the Monica Baey incident claiming that she had \u201cno recourse\u201d except to pressure NUS, that is completely misleading.\u00a0 First, as we have pointed out above, the Police and the AGC have considerations of deterrence and rehabilitation in determining whether to prosecute or not.\u00a0 We should highlight the following \u2013 As a matter of opinion, Alex Tan is entitled to say that the Singapore Police should have focused on the rage and retribution desired by the public (and Monica Baey).\u00a0\u00a0But as a matter of principle, it is equally acceptable that due consideration be given to the principles of deterrence and rehabilitation. The right of the AGC to decide why it wishes to prosecute or not to prosecute is enshrined in Singapore\u2019s Constitution \u2013 It is wholly illogical to usurp that authority and demand that the AGC (the Public Prosecutor\u2019s agency) cave in to public demands.\u00a0\u00a0\nFurther, the police do NOT control NUS\u2019s actions.\u00a0 The inadequacy of NUS in dealing with the offence is a separate topic, and we have covered this extensively in our factchecks on the case here, here and here.\nThe\u00a0 Singapore Police never \u201cKicked up a Storm\u201d\nOn the egging incidents \u2013 It is true that 2 men were questioned by the police for making statements that they wished to throw an egg at Minister K Shanmugam, but this was an investigation to confirm if their intentions were serious and was not a punishment.\u00a0 See the various articles covering the incident here:\n\nYahoo News\u2019 article;\nStraits Times\u2019 article;\nMothership\u2019s article;\nThe New Paper\u2019s article.\n\nIt is important to point out that, unanimously, the various reports have highlighted that investigations were focused on establishing if any serious intention was being expressed to commit the act.\nIt is also important to point out that the police were acting on the basis of police reports made against each man.\u00a0 In other words, the police were not acting on their own accord, but because another party had raised the matter to the police to investigate.\nFinally, do note that the offence investigated is Section 267C of the Penal Code, which is the offence of communicating an electronic record to incite violence.\u00a0 This is regarded as a serious offence that is arrestable without warrant.\nLawyers interviewed in the report by Yahoo News had differing takes on whether the men were guilty of the offence.\nOn the rubber band littering incident\u00a0you can read about the incident here \u2013 The Singapore Police were NOT involved in this incident.\u00a0 Prosecution for littering offences falls under the ambit of the National Environment Agency (NEA).\u00a0 NEA\u2019s roving enforcement teams regularly conduct site checks and identify littering offenders. Not the police.\n",
