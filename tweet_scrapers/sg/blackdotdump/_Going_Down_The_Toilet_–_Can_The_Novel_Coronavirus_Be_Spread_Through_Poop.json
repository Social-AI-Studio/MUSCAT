    "Paragraphs": "\n\nAnother day, another mass-forwarded PSA.\n\nAs tempting as it is to pass off this statement as a gross exaggeration (\u201cturned to vapour by the force of a toilet flushing\u201d\u2026really?), there\u2019s actually some truth in it.\nChinese state media reported on 2 February that the Wuhan coronavirus may also be transmitted \u201cto a certain degree\u201d through the digestive tract and into human faeces, and not just through droplets from coughs and sneezes that contain the virus.\nScientists from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said that virus genetic material was discovered in patient stool and rectal swabs. They also noted that some patients infected with the coronavirus had diarrhoea early in the disease, instead of the more common symptom of a fever.\nResearchers also cited a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine where a stool sample taken from the first person confirmed in the US to have the novel coronavirus tested positive for the virus.\nHowever, Feng Luzhao, a researcher with the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a daily press conference held by the National Health Commission on Sunday that \u201cfurther investigation\u201d is still needed to prove transmission through this method.\nFindings are \u201cnot surprising\u201d\nChang Ko, head of the infection control division of Kaohsiung Municipal Siaogang Hospital in Taiwan, said that it \u201cwas not surprising\u201d if transmission could happen via the faecal-oral route.\nHead of the Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections at Chang Gung University Shih Shin-ru added that the new findings \u201csuggest preventing the spread of the virus will be more challenging, because there is another way it can be transmitted\u201d.\nFang Li, an associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at the University of Minnesota said that \u201cSARS and Wuhan viruses bind to the same distinctly shaped protein receptors in the body that are expressed in the lungs and intestines, making these organs the primary targets for both viruses\u201d.\nDiarrhoea, which occurred in about 10 to 20% of patients with SARS, was implicated as the source of a SARS outbreak in Hong Kong\u2019s Amoy Gardens resident complex back in 2003.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) found that the SARS virus remained stable for up to four days in the faeces of infected people with diarrhoea, and this contributed to \u201ca significant viral load being discharged into a broken sewage system\u201d.\nKeep your chin up, but the lid down\nHwang Kao-pin, director of the division of paediatric infectious diseases at China Medical University in Taichung, said \u201cit was not uncommon to find viruses in stool\u201d, and that the pressure of the splashing water from a flushing toilet might result in particles of the coronavirus-infected stool being dispersed into the air.\nThese infected particles can survive in air for 2 to 3 hours, and up to five days on the surface of an object.\nHe added that to reduce the risk of infection, toilets should be disinfected with alcohol before they are used and flushed with their lids down. This is in addition to washing hands with soap after going to the toilet.\nA new study, released 13 February by Hong Kong\u2019s City University\u2019s Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, also found that the act of flushing a toilet can release \u201cup to 80,000 polluted droplets and leave them suspended a metre in the air for hours\u201d if the lid is left up.\nIt also found that smaller bacteria are \u201ceven more likely\u201d to become airborne and transmitted into the surrounding area via droplets.\n\u201cCovering the toilet lid while flushing is definitely essential, but it should not be considered a complete prevention,\u201d said Alvin Lai Chi-keung, associate head of the department that led the study.\nHe advised households to clean their washrooms using diluted bleach on a regular basis, maintain good ventilation, and to close the door if not in use.\nLai noted that \u201che was not intending to add to public fear amid the outbreak of COVID-19\u201d with the release of the study\u2019s results.\nAnother study published on US National Library of Medicine\u2019s website in 2012 which studied how toilet plume (dispersal of microscopic particles from the flushing of a toilet) can transmit infectious diseases concluded that it \u201ccould play an important role in the transmission of infectious diseases for which the pathogen is shed in faeces or vomit\u201d, but added that further studies are still required to assess the risks posed by toilet plume.\nInterestingly though, the study pointed out that the possible role of toilet plume in airborne transmission of norovirus, SARS, and pandemic influenza is \u201cof particular interest\u201d.\nTherefore, while it is true that genetic material of the novel coronavirus was found in the stool sample of an infected patient, the claim that the virus can be transmitted through infected stools is unproven, and\u00a0there are no reported cases of infection via faecal matter to date either. We will update the article as soon as more info is available.\n\nIn general, we\u2019ll still recommend that you flush with the toilet lid down, and practice good hand hygiene.\n",
