    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this Facebook comment:\n\nThe comment was in response to a post in which shared a link to an article on Today about how the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for use in Singapore and how there will be enough for everyone here by the third quarter of 2021.\nThe author of the comment states that the Singapore government is trying to \u201cscam\u201d the public into taking \u201cthis poison vaccine\u201d by making it free. The author adds that this is part of an \u201cagenda 21 depopulation and vaccine plan\u201d. Along with the caption is a photo of a list titled \u201cUN Agenda 21/2030 Mission Goals\u201d.\nOn the list are items including \u201cOne World Central Bank\u201d, \u201cOne World Military\u201d, \u201cThe end of the family unit\u201d, \u201cUniversal basic income\u201d, \u201cDepopulation, control of population growth and population density\u201d, and \u201cMandatory multiple vaccines\u201d.\nIs there a \u2018New World Order\u2019?\nIf the title \u201cUN Agenda 21/2030 Mission Goals\u201d sounds confusing, that\u2019s because it is actually a combination of the UN\u2019s Agenda 21, a non-binding action plan of the United Nations developed in 1992 with regard to sustainable development, and its 2030 Agenda, a list of 17 goals adopted by UN Member States in 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.\nBelow is a screenshot of the list of 17 goals listed in the UN 2030 Agenda:\n\n\n\nClaims have been debunked before\nThis purported list of \u201cUN Agenda 21/2030 Mission Goals\u201d has been debunked before, after it was seen being circulated on social media platforms.\nIn a fact-check by AFP, a UN spokesperson told AFP via email on 27 June 2020 that: \u201cAll of the items on the list from the website are either completely false or twisted beyond the truth.\u201d\nAFP also contacted Heidi Beirich, the author of a 2014 report on Agenda 21 conspiracy theories, who said that the post is \u201cfilled with all the bogus claims the far right has made against [Agenda 21] for a long time now\u201d. She added that the claims about the UN 2030 Agenda are also \u201cjust a false attempt to paint sensible plans for sustainable development as some sort of communist plan, which it is not\u201d.\nIt is interesting to see how this list has somehow reemerged and embedded itself in the local context.\nRegardless, the claim that getting vaccinated is part of an \u201cagenda 21 depopulation and vaccine plan\u201d is false.\n\n\n\n",
