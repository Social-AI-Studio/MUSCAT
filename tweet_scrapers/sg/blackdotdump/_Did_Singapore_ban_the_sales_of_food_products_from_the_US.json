    "Paragraphs": "\nIn this piece, we visit a claim that we explored last month, but has reemerged recently. This time, in a different country.\nFor context, we came across a tweet in early August, which revealed that an article which suggested that the US had \u201cintentionally contaminated fruits slated for export to Asia and Africa with coronavirus\u201d was being circulated in pro-China WhatsApp groups.\nWhile we were unable to find the link to the \u95ea\u7535\u65b0\u95fb (which literally translates to \u2018Lightning News\u2019) article, we were able to find a link to an article\u00a0with the similar title and header image being used:\n\nOther than the claim about the US intentionally contaminating exported fruits and food products with COVID-19, the article also suggested that this was reported by Singapore media.\nWe were unable to find any reports on local media about these claims, and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) also clarified in a Facebook post that they had not issued any statement discouraging consumption of imports from the US, Europe or Brazil, and neither has the Singapore media made such a report.\nSFA added that they were also \u201cnot aware of any evidence that suggests that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted to humans via food or food packaging and equipment\u201d, and that this is \u201cthe current state of knowledge across scientific communities and public health authorities worldwide\u201d.\nHowever, they assured that they would be continuing to monitor developments closely, and will promptly take any necessary actions to safeguard food safety in Singapore.\nClaim reemerged\u2026in Thailand?\nIn a fact-check by AFP Thailand, we come to know of a message that was being circulated on messaging platform Line recently:\n\nAccording to AFP Thailand, the message (which is in Thai) translates to \u201cDon\u2019t buy or eat vegetables and fruits from the US\u2026 Singapore has forbidden people from doing so already. This is because the US used trucks that carry bodies of those infected with COVID-19 to carry food too, so the food will also be contaminated with the virus.\u201d\nThe similar message was also being circulated on Facebook:\n\n\n\nAFP Thailand rated the claim that Singapore has \u201cforbidden\u201d people from purchasing food products from the US as misleading, referencing the clarification post by SFA which stated that they had not issued any statement discouraging consumption of imports from the US, Europe or Brazil.\nAFP Thailand also delved into the claim that COVID-19 can be transmitted via food.\nIn a phone conversation with AFP on 13 August, Dr. Thira Worathanarat, an associate professor in the Department of Preventive and Social Medicine at Thailand\u2019s Chulalongkorn University said that \u201cthere is no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted to humans via fruits and vegetables\u201d. However, he added that people should still be careful and clean their fruits and vegetables before eating them. He also recommended that people eat well-cooked food.\nAFP Thailand\u2019s fact-check also cited how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US and the European Food Safety Authority had stated that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that supports the claim.\nThese are in line with SFA\u2019s stance.\nTherefore, the claim that Singapore has \u201cforbidden\u201d people from buying and eating vegetables and fruits from the US is false.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s still interesting to observe how in spite of international borders being closed, a misleading claim as such has still managed to \u2018travel\u2019 overseas and take root there.\n",
