    "Paragraphs": "\n\nUpdate: On 23 January, the Singapore government directed the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to issue access blocking orders for Lawyers of Liberty\u2019s (LFL) website after the Malaysian human rights lawyers organisation\u2019s \u201cnon-compliance\u201d with the correction direction issued against a statement it made.\nIn a statement issued by the Ministry for Communications and Information (MCI), the ministry said that \u201cthe access blocking orders will ensure that the falsehoods do not continue to be communicated in Singapore without the facts placed alongside them\u201d. Access blocking orders would be cancelled should LFL carry the correction notice required by the correction direction.\nAs of 28 January 2020, 9:18am, Lawyers for Liberty\u2019s website is still accessible.\n\u2013\nLast November, Malaysian human rights lawyers organisation Lawyers For Liberty (LFL) revealed that it had received \u201cshocking information\u201d about \u201cunlawful and extremely brutal methods\u201d being used to execute prisoners in Singapore\u2019s Changi prison.\nLFL\u2019s advisor N Surendran said that the organisation is \u201cprepared to reveal this evidence, supplied by prison officers, in due course\u201d.\nThen, LFL stated that they had written to the Singapore authorities to inform them that they are \u201cprepared to meet them and handover the evidence\u201d.\nOn 16 January 2020 (Thursday), we were alerted to a statement that LFL published on its website titled \u201cDisclosure of the brutal & unlawful hanging methods in Changi prison \u2013 brutal kicks inflicted to snap prisoners\u2019 necks\u201d.\nThe statement served as an update on the matter, and claimed that a Singapore Prison Services (SPS) officer is prepared to come forward and offer information about the alleged \u201cbrutal and unlawful methods\u201d used to execute prisoners in Singapore\u2019s Changi prison.\nAccording to LFL\u2019s statement, the SPS officer they are in contact with is said to have served at the execution chamber in Changi prison, and had carried out some of the hangings himself.\nLFL said that the abovementioned SPS officer had offered evidence that he and other prison officers were instructed to carry out a certain procedure whenever the rope breaks during a hanging \u2013 something which he claimed \u201chappens from time to time\u201d.\nLFL claimed they received information that prison officers were given \u201cspecial training\u201d to carry out the following execution method:\na) The prison officer is instructed to pull the rope around the neck of the prisoner towards him.\nb) Meanwhile, another prison officer will apply pressure by pulling the body in the opposite direction.\nc) The first officer must then kick the back of the neck of the prisoner with great force in order to break it.\nd) The officers are told to kick the back of the neck because that would be consistent with death by hanging.\ne) The officers are told not to kick more than 2 times, so that there will be no tell-tale marks in case there is an autopsy.\nf) Strict orders are also given not to divulge the above to other prison staff not involved in executions.\nLFL called the execution method \u201cunlawful as the mode of execution prescribed by law is hanging by the neck, and not execution by brutal kicking of the neck\u201d.\nLFL added that this is a \u201cflagrant breach\u201d of Article 9 of the Singapore Constitution which is to \u201cprohibit cruel and unusual punishments\u201d.\n\nLFL claimed that this procedure is \u201cbeing done surreptitiously\u201d, and alleged that specific measures are even adopted \u201cto ensure that nothing incriminating is revealed during any subsequent autopsy\u201d.\nWe reached out to SPS on 17 January 2020 (Friday) in hopes to shed light on these claims, and asked for two pieces of information:\n\nStatistics on the incidences that the rope breaks during a hanging\nThe procedure carried out when that happens\n\nAt time of publication, we have yet to receive a reply from SPS.\nLFL ended its statement calling for the Singapore Government to consider the following steps:\ni) To immediately impose a moratorium on all executions in Singapore pending investigations or a Commission of Inquiry into this matter.\nii) To handover a copy of the findings to Malaysia, many of whose citizens have been executed in Changi or are facing execution.\niii) To reveal the number and identities of Malaysian prisoners who have been executed using this brutal method in Changi.\niv) To agree to compensate families for the unlawful execution of their loved ones.\nMHA refutes claims, invokes POFMA\nToday (22 January 2020), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has come forward with a response to LFL\u2019s allegations, calling it \u201cuntrue, baseless and preposterous\u201d.\n\u201cAll judicial executions are conducted in the presence of the Superintendent of the Prison and a medical doctor, among others. The law also requires a Coroner (who is a Judicial Officer of the State Courts) to conduct an inquiry within 24 hours of the execution to satisfy himself that the execution was carried out duly and properly,\u201d MHA said.\nIt further clarified that \u201cthe rope used for judicial executions has never broken before\u201d, and that prison officers \u201ccertainly do not receive any special training to carry out the brutal execution method\u201d as alleged by LFL.\n\u201cAny acts such as those described in the LFL statement would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt with.\u201d\nMHA has also instructed the POFMA office to issue corrections against LFL and three other parties: Kirsten Han\u2019s Facebook post that shared LFL\u2019s statement, The Online Citizen\u2019s online article that contained the falsehoods and Yahoo Singapore\u2019s Facebook post which shared an article that contained the falsehoods.\nThey would be required to carry a correction notice alongside their posts or articles and state that these posts or articles contain falsehoods.\nIn its statement, the ministry added that LFL \u201chas been publishing various falsehoods to seek attention in hopes of getting Malaysian prisoners, who have been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death in Singapore, off the death penalty\u201d.\nLFL, The Online Citizen, Kirsten Han respond\nIn a Facebook post this morning, Kirsten Han shared that she received a Correction Direction from the POFMA Office, and that she has until 8am on 23 January 2020 (Thursday) to comply with the direction.\nShe added that after reading LFL\u2019s initial statement issued on 16 January 2020, she sent a follow-up to the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) asking for a response, \u201cas well as other questions about executions in prison and their standard protocol\u201d.\nHan stated that she is \u201csomeone who has been invested in the issue of the death penalty for a long time\u201d and was therefore \u201cextremely interested in doing a story taking into account both LFL and the prison\u2019s statements\u201d.\nHan continued, stating that since she received no response from SPS, she followed up with them again on 17 January 2020.\nHer claims were backed up with screenshots of the emails and questions she sent to SPS which she posted on her Twitter account.\nHan ended her Facebook post saying that she would be using \u201cthe rest of the time given under the Correction Direction to decide\u201d how she should proceed.\nThe Online Citizen (TOC) also provided an update on Facebook, sharing that they have \u201cfiled an application to the minister to cancel the direction [and] the minister has three days to consider the application\u201d before TOC can take the matter to court.\nLFL has also come forward with a new statement, firstly asserting that they \u201cabsolutely stand by [their] statement\u201d which they claim to be \u201cbased upon evidence from former and current Singapore prison officers [\u2026] with impeccable service records\u201d.\nCalling POFMA an \u201coppressive and undemocratic law\u201d, LFL\u2019s director Melissa Sasidaran, who issued the statement, said that it was \u201coutrageous and unacceptable for Singapore to issue a notice under their POFMA to a Malaysian organisation such as LFL, which is operating and issuing statements on Malaysian soil\u201d.\nShe added that \u201cThis is nothing short of an attempt to silence us and prevent the truth about the manner of executions from coming out.\u201d\nSasidaran asserted that they would not comply with the direction to withdraw their statement, and demanded that the Correction Direction \u201cbe unconditionally withdrawn with immediate effect by the Singapore government\u201d.\nAcknowledging that Correction Directions have also been issued to \u201cSingaporean citizens and organisations, including The Online Citizen (TOC) and prominent activist Kirsten Han\u201d, Sasidaran concluded the statement asking that these notices also be withdrawn.\nWe have reached out to LFL to ask for evidence that would support their claim, but have not received a response at point of publication.\nIn light of the lack of evidence from LFL at point of publication and the lack of reports suggesting that such events have ever occurred, we rate the claims made by LFL to be likely false.\n\n",
