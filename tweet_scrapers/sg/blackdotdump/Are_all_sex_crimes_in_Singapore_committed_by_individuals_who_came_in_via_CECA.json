    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this post on Facebook:\n\nThe author of the post claims that he noticed that \u201call sex crimes in Singapore [have been] perpetrated by Ceca\u201d.\nFor context, \u2018CECA\u2019 is the abbreviation for the\u00a0India \u2013 Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, a trade agreement that came into force 1 August 2005. However, the term has in recent times been used by certain netizens as a slur when referring to Indian nationals who have moved to Singapore.\nThis particular claim we\u2019re highlighting unfortunately isn\u2019t unprecedented, given that we have done several fact-checks recently with regard to claims made about CECA and the individuals linked to it \u2013 one\u00a0on a \u2018CECA youth\u2019 planning an attack on two mosques,\u00a0another on Temasek Holdings\u2019 new CEO, another on the number of overseas Indians in Singapore, and one about the perpetrator in a recent maid abuse incident.\nThere are a few commenters who have called out the author for making an inflammatory statement without proper evidence:\n\nHowever, it is still unsettling that there are quite a number who have not just agreed with the author, but even attributed the allegations to culture and genetics:\n\nEven without checking on reported sex-related crimes, it is already highly improbable that all of such cases can be attributed to individuals from a certain group. Regardless, a quick check on The Straits Times, TODAY, and CNA on the latest reported sex-related crimes already prove that the author\u2019s statement is erroneous.\nThese are the latest sex-related crimes reported on TODAY:\n\nIn the cases where the perpetrator was identified (here, here, here, here, and here), the individuals were neither Indian nationals or even of Indian ethnicity. In those where the perpetrator was not identified (here, here and here), there is also no evidence to suggest either.\nTherefore, the claim that \u201call sex crimes in Singapore [have been] perpetrated by Ceca\u201d is false.\n\n",
