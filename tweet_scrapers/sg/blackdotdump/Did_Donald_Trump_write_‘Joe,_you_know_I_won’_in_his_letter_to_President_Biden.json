    "Paragraphs": "\nThe United States of America has a new president, and\u00a0current POTUS Joe Biden told reporters at the White House that outgoing president Donald Trump left him a \u201cvery generous letter\u201d in the Oval Office, a tradition started by former President Ronald Reagan for his vice president George H.W. Bush.\nThe letter came as a somewhat pleasant surprise, given how Mr Trump had failed to maintain other traditions like communicating with and attending the inauguration of his successor.\nAdded President Biden about the letter: \u201cBecause it\u2019s private, I will not talk about it until I talk to him.\u201d\nThe White House is also remaining tight-lipped about the contents of the letter, with spokesperson Judd Deere simply telling USA Today that \u201cit\u2019s a letter between (presidents) 45 and 46\u201d.\nDue to this, social media has been rife with speculations of what the contents of the letter could be. An image, purportedly of the letter that Mr Trump left for President Biden, is being shared widely. Here\u2019s a\u00a0tweet that uploaded the image of the alleged letter:\n\nA factcheck by PolitiFact has linked the source of the image to a blog on a particular simonparkes.org, posted on 20 January 2021. The post writes: \u201cI was sent this 5pm British time \u2013 And asked not to share for 1 hour. This Trump letter was left on the President\u2019s desk for Biden.\u201d along with the image of the letter. It is not certain how the author of the blog managed to get a copy of what he claims is the letter written by Mr Trump.\nThe factcheck by PolitiFact pointed out that the letter does not use the\u00a0same seal\u00a0featured in other official letters Trump sent, and the format of the date is also different when compared with letters from Trump that have been made public.\nPolitiFact added that White House spokesperson Deere did not respond to their questions about the post.\nGiven the lack of evidence that this is indeed what was written in Mr Trump\u2019s letter and the lack of clarification from Deere, the claim is therefore likely false.\n\nIt is amusing to note, however, other obviously satirical takes on the letter.\nHere\u2019s one from local media site SGAG:\n\n",
