    "Paragraphs": "\nThis is true.\n\nOn 16 March 2019, Agence France Presse published an article relating to the NZ Mass Shooting incident of 15 March 2019. A copy is accessible in the link below.\n\nThe article stated amongst other things that:\n\u201cUS President Donald Trump condemned the \u201chorrible massacre\u201d in which \u201cinnocent people have so senselessly died\u201d, but denied that the problem of right-wing extremism was widespread.\u201d\nThe above statement appears to have been made based on a Twitter post from the US President\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nMy warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died, with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 15, 2019\n\nThe denial given by President Trump, however, was reported in a media interview with the President in the Oval Office. He is reported to have said:\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess. If you look what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that\u2019s the case. I don\u2019t know enough about it yet\u2026But it\u2019s certainly a terrible thing.\u201d\n\nSee more reports here and here.\n",
