    "Paragraphs": "\n\nOn 10 September 2019, a Facebook page called \u2018Trust me, I\u2019m Singaporean\u2019 posted the following:\n\nThe image for the post was obtained from another Facebook page called \u201cMatchy Matchy\u201d.\nThe post challenged readers to spot either a Singaporean or Chinese and claimed that there was a People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) Member of Parliament (MP) in the picture.\u00a0 Many readers believed that the picture showed the DBS Singapore office with a large majority of employees who are non-Singaporean.\nThe post is misleading.\u00a0 The picture dates back to September 2017, featuring DBS India employees in Mumbai, and there is no basis to suggest that DBS Bank has an unfair hiring policy.\nThe photograph is actually a \u201cwefie\u201d taken on September 5, 2017, at Express Towers, Nariman Point, Mumbai, where DBS Bank was celebrating the launch of a new office there.\u00a0 In addition to having published the original picture on their Instagram page (see below), the event was reported by Percept ICE, the public relations company which handled the event (read the report here).\n\u00a0\nThere was also no PAP MP in the photo.\u00a0 In the foreground of the photo, 2 gentlemen stand out \u2013 first, Mr Piyush Gupta, the Chief Executive Officer and Director of the DBS Group.\u00a0 Second, Mr Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, an Indian former international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team.\u00a0 Two years ago, he collaborated with DBS in an effort to enrich the lives of kids through the medium of sports.\nRead more on his shared purpose with DBS here.\n\nThe post by \u201cTrust Me, I\u2019m Singaporean\u201d contained no information about where and when this image was taken (or where it was allegedly found). \u00a0This suggests that the deception was deliberate.\u00a0 If this is the case, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time an image of a large crowd has been misappropriated to foster a misleading impression on a range of social issues.\nInterestingly, we note that in the 2 places where the misleading post was featured, some online readers were extremely quick to point out that the post was misleading, and further that these responses by the online community appeared to be in response to misplaced anger expressed by some readers who had believed the misleading suggestion of the original post.\nAs we scan the web for misleading information, we notice that the more blatant or ridiculous a piece of fake news is, the faster the responses come in pointing out the falsehood.\u00a0 It also helps that there are powerful online tools that can reverse-check images and provide extremely fast guidance on whether a claim is true or false.\nFor images, we tend to use Tineye image search or Google image search.\u00a0 Give these tools a try! The next time you see a suspicious image, screenshot the image and upload it on to either of the above search tools and see the results that are generated.\n\u00a0\n",
