    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this post on Facebook:\n\u2018\nFor context, US Vice-President Kamala Harris\u2019 flight to Vietnam from Singapore scheduled for 24 August was delayed by several hours due to an \u201canomalous health incident\u201d \u2013 a term that the US government usually uses to refer to the \u2018Havana syndrome\u2019 which has affected hundreds of US officials over the past few years.\nThe condition is of unknown origins and symptoms include dizziness, nausea, migraines, and memory lapses. In December, a US National Academy of Sciences panel found that a plausible theory is that the syndrome is caused by \u201cdirected energy\u201d beams. The CIA said that it sees a \u201cvery strong possibility\u201d that the syndrome is intentionally caused, and that Russia could be responsible, but is \u201cwithholding definitive conclusions pending further investigation\u201d. However, Moscow has denied involvement.\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki added that the Havana syndrome case was reported in Vietnam before Harris\u2019 departure but it was not confirmed at that point of time. Eventually, \u201cafter careful assessment\u201d, Ms Harris and her delegation decided to continue the trip to Hanoi.\nAccording to the author of the Facebook post, this incident was due to a certain party \u201ctrying to send a message by launching their attack on Singapore, where Harris was present\u201d. The author also shared a link to an article on politicususa.com, which reported that the delay was due to \u201ca possible Havana syndrome incident at the US embassy in Singapore\u201d.\nThe article also includes a tweet from PoliticusUSA\u2019s editor-in-chief which states that \u201ctwo US diplomats in Singapore (were) medevaced due to a suspected Havana Syndrome incident\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s rather puzzling how the author of the article and the editor-in-chief concluded that the incident happened in Singapore, because further down in the article, we read that they had quoted a report on NBC News:\n\nAs seen in the screenshot, the two US diplomats were medically evacuated from the US Embassy in Vietnam, not Singapore.\nWhen we took a look at the original NBC report, we see clearly that it was reported that:\n\nAccording to two senior US officials, at least two US diplomats will be medically evacuated from Vietnam after \u2018Havana Syndrome\u2019 incidents were reported over the weekend in Hanoi ahead of Ms Harris\u2019 arrival\nThe cases caused a brief delay in Harris\u2019 scheduled trip to Vietnam, and the vice president\u2019s office said \u201cHarris\u2019 delegation was delayed from departing Singapore because of the report of a \u2018recent possible anomalous health incident\u2019 in Hanoi\u201d\n\nReports on multiple news platforms (CNN, BBC, The Guardian, ABC News, and Reuters, just to name a few) have also stated that the cases were reported in Hanoi, not Singapore.\nTherefore, it is false that the Havana syndrome incident happened at the US embassy in Singapore. It is also false that two US diplomats in Singapore were medically evacuated due to the suspected Havana syndrome incident.\n\n",
