Trevor's team of correspondents -- Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, Desi Lydic, Dulc\u00e9 Sloan, Jaboukie Young-White and Roy Wood Jr. -- along with contributors Lewis Black and Jordan Klepper provide coverage of (and catharsis from) daily events through a sharp, reality-based lens. Trevor also sits down with the people making news to get their unfiltered takes on U.S. culture, foreign affairs and more."
