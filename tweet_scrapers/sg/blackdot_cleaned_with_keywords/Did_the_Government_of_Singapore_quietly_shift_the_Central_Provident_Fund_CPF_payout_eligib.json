    "Title": "Did the Government of Singapore quietly shift the Central Provident Fund (CPF) payout eligibility age from 65 years to 70 years?  ",
    "Tags": [],
    "Paragraphs": "\nNo. This is untrue. See the clarifications below.\n\nDid the CPF Board fail to assist Singaporeans by making it an opt-in step for CPF members to write to CPF to start payment from 65 years old or later, otherwise for payment to automatically start from 70 years old?\n\nNo. For 2 main reasons.\nFirst, prior to CPF LIFE providing the above opt-in step, no payments would, in fact, be made even at age 70, if there was no instruction given to CPF Board to start payouts.\nSecond, it would appear that CPF took a view to give an option to permit one to earn more \u2013 If funds continue to be kept and not paid out at 65, CPF members can earn 7% more if withdrawals begin at 70.\nRead more about it here.\n\n\n",
