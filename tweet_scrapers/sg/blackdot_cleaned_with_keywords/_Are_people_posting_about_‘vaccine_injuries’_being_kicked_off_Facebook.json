    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this post on Facebook:\n\nThe author of the post shares a post by a US-based Facebook user who uploaded a photo of what looks to be an individual\u2019s lower arm with bulging veins. Along with the photo, the Facebook user writes that this is the result of her friend\u2019s sister taking the \u201c1st covid experimental vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna)\u201d. In response to this, the author of the post writes that \u201cpeople posting about vaccine injuries are getting kicked off FB\u201d because \u201cthis is the stuff they don\u2019t want you to know\u201d.\nThere are two claims to be explored here, so let\u2019s look at them one at a time.\nClaim #1: Vaccine results in bulging veins\nAs mentioned in the post, the Facebook user\u2019s friend\u2019s sister was administered either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine (both of which are authorised to be used in Singapore). Currently, three COVID-19 vaccines have been authorised for use in the US \u2013 Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Jassen.\nWhen we looked at CDC\u2019s website for the side effects of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, we see that both list the same possible side effects:\n\nAs seen, there is no mention of \u2018bulging veins\u2019 on one\u2019s arm. Could it be what\u2019s listed to be \u2018swelling\u2019 then?\nFor a cross-reference, we looked at MOH\u2019s website for possible side effects and see that swelling could happen \u201cat the injection site\u201d.\n\nGiven that both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are administered at the upper arm, the photo posted can\u2019t possibly be a depiction of said swelling that could happen at the injection site.\nCould it then be the swelling of lymph nodes, as indicated in the table by MOH?\nAccording to the American Cancer Society\u2019s website, we read that while there are hundreds of lymph nodes throughout the body, the areas where lymph nodes commonly swell are in the neck, groin, and underarms. We also read in a report that doctors in the US have seen \u201cmore and more of these swollen (lymph) nodes in recently immunised people\u201d, but that the swelling is a \u201cnormal reaction by the immune system to the vaccine, and occurs on the same side as the arm where the shot was given\u201d. The article also adds that the swelling of lymph nodes in the armpit is a recognised side effect in the large trials of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.\nIn addition, lymph nodes are described as \u201csmooth pea-sized lumps\u201d and when swollen, \u201cmay feel firm and the size of a pea or grape\u201d, something that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case in the photo that was uploaded.\nTherefore, given the lack of reports and evidence at this point of time that the \u2018bulging veins\u2019 as seen in the photo is a potential side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine, the claim is likely false.\n\nClaim #2: People posting about \u2018vaccine injuries\u2019\u00a0are getting kicked off Facebook\nWe refer to a recent Facebook announcement made on 15 March, in which various plans have been revealed by the platform to get more people vaccinated. Most significantly, we see that Facebook has\u00a0expanded the list of false claims that they will remove to include additional debunked claims about the coronavirus and vaccines. According to the platform, they have removed an additional 2 million pieces of content since launching this new policy in February.\nFacebook added that in order to \u201cpromote authoritative information about COVID-19 vaccines\u201d, they have also implemented several temporary measures to further limit the spread of \u201cpotentially harmful COVID-19 and vaccine information\u201d. The measures listed by Facebook are as follows:\n\nReducing the distribution of\n\ncontent from users that have violated Facebook\u2019s policies on COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation or that have repeatedly shared content debunked as False or Altered by Facebook\u2019s third-party fact-checking partners, and of\nany COVID-19 or vaccine content that fact-checking partners have rated as \u201cMissing Context.\u201d\n\n\nRequiring admins for groups with admins or members who have violated Facebook\u2019s COVID-19 policies to temporarily approve all posts within their group.\nContinuing to further elevate information from authoritative sources when people seek information about COVID-19 or vaccines.\n\nIn a clarification to TechCrunch on why users who repeatedly violate Facebook\u2019s COVID-19 policies not face \u201cat least a period of suspension\u201d, Facebook stated that \u201canyone who repeatedly breaks its policies will be removed from its platform\u201d.\nIt is important to note that the author shared a post from a group literally called \u201cVACCINE INJURY STORIES\u201d where users are still actively posting on.\nTherefore, while it is true that individuals who repeatedly violate Facebook\u2019s COVID-19 policies will get removed from the platform, the insinuation that anyone who posts about \u2018vaccine injuries\u2019 gets \u201ckicked off\u201d Facebook is false.\n\n",
