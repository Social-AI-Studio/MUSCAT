    "Paragraphs": "\n\nBarely a month after losing his role as Malaysia\u2019s Finance Minister, Lim Guan Eng has once again been thrust into the spotlight, for a crime which his son allegedly committed.\nMalaysian Chinese-language newspaper Nanyang Siang Pau published an article on 14 March which reported that the \u201cchild of a senior Pakatan Harapan leader\u201d was arrested in Singapore with an undeclared sum of money amounting to RM2 million.\nThe report was quoted by Malaysia Today with a headline that read \u201cGuan Eng\u2019s Son Arrested Entering Singapore With US$2 Million\u201d.\nMr Lim was understood to be one of the more vocal critics during the 1MDB saga, where former Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak still faces charges of money laundering. A netizen had pointed out the irony of Mr Lim\u2019s own son being arrested for a related crime.\n\nA quick check on Google surfaced an article by Malaysian mainstream news outlet The Star Online which reported the Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Abdul Hamid Bador, denying these allegations.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely not true.\u201d\n\u201cWe have not gotten any report that his (Lim\u2019s) son was detained in Singapore.\u201d\n\u201cThis is definitely fake news being spread,\u201d\n\u201cWe will investigate who is spreading such fake news.\u201d\n\u201cWe will get to the bottom of the matter.\u201d\n\nThis was also reported on Malaysiakini. In light of these reports by Malaysian media outlets, we rate this allegation as false.\n\n",
