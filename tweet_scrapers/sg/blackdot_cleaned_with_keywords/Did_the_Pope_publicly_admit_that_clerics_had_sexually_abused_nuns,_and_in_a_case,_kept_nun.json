    "Paragraphs": "\nOn 6 February 2019, the BBC reported that \u201cPope Francis has admitted that clerics have sexually abused nuns, and in one case they were kept as sex slaves.\u201d\nThis statement may be misleading. We caution that the words of Pope Francis are unclear and subject to interpretation.\n\n\nThe BBC report is one of many similar news reports about Pope Francis\u2019 statements made during a 6 February 2019 press conference on board his plane returning to Rome from the United Arab Emirates. The \u2018sex slave\u2019 statement arose from Pope Francis praising his predecessor\u2019s act of dissolving the Community of St Jean, which had, in 2013, admitted that the reverend of the Community had behaved in ways that \u201cwent against chastity\u201d.\nAccording to various other news sources, the Vatican spokesperson has clarified that the Pope had meant that there was \u201cmanipulation\u201d rather than sexual enslaving.\n\u201cWhen the Holy Father, referring to the dissolution of a Congregation, spoke of \u2018sexual slavery,\u2019 he meant \u2018manipulation,\u2019 a form of abuse of power which is reflected also in sexual abuse,\u201d said Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti.\nPerhaps the most balanced reporting came from the Associated Press, which reported the words of the Pope as follows:\n\u201cFrancis was asked about priests who target adult women \u2014 the religious sisters who are the backbone of the Catholic Church\u2019s education, health care and social service ministries around the globe \u2014 and whether the Holy See might consider a similar universal approach to combat that issue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that everyone does this, but there have been priests and bishops who have,\u201d Francis told reporters. \u201cAnd I think that it\u2019s continuing because it\u2019s not like once you realize it that it stops. It continues. And for some time we\u2019ve been working on it.\u201d\n\u201cShould we do something more? Yes. Is there the will? Yes. But it\u2019s a path that we have already begun,\u201d Francis said.\n[Regarding the Community of St Jean case] He said [his predecessor, Pope Benedict] acted \u201cbecause a certain slavery of women had crept in, slavery to the point of sexual slavery on the part of clergy or the founder,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSometimes the founder takes away, or empties the freedom of the sisters. It can come to this,\u201d Francis said.\n\u201cThere are cases, usually in new congregations and in some regions more than others,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it.\u201d\n\u201cPray that this goes forward,\u201d he said of the Vatican efforts to fight it. \u201cI want it to go forward.\u201d\n\n",
