    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this message being forwarded on WhatsApp:\n\nAccording to the message, Singapore has declared a month-long \u201cPhase 2 (Heightened Alert)\u201d from 19 July in response to a recent rise in COVID-19 cases.\nFor context, it was reported on 14 July that a total of 42 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore have been linked to a KTV lounge cluster. Cases linked to KTV lounges first emerged on 12 July. As of 15 July 12pm, MOH reported another 42 new cases of locally transmitted cases, of which 33 belong to the KTV cluster. This brings the total number of cases linked to the cluster to 87, as of 15 July.\nBelow is a figure by MOH which depicts the number of Community Unlinked Cases, and Linked Cases by Already Quarantined/ Detected through Surveillance, and Dormitory Resident Cases:\n\nAs seen, there\u2019s a spike in the number of cases following the emergence of the KTV lounge cluster. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung called the situation \u201cvery troubling and disappointing\u201d, and shared with reporters that more infections linked to the cluster are expected in the coming days as contract tracing continues.\nThe Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) had announced updated measures as part of Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) who took place from 12 July 2021 as part of a gradual resumption of more economic and community activities. If what is claimed in the message is true, this would mean that Singapore would once again revert to more restrictive measures on business and social activities.\nHowever, if you\u2019re a seasoned Black Dot Research follower, you would have probably found the URL suspiciously long and even familiar. Yes, we have once again been \u2018graced\u2019 with the presence of the finger-flipping gorilla that has appeared in multiple\u00a0instances\u00a0previously.\nFor the unacquainted, note that while the\u00a0first link\u00a0leads to CNA\u2019s main page, the\u00a0second link leads to\u2026something else completely.\nRegardless, given that there has been no announcement of nor indication that Singapore is heading back into Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) from 19 July, the claim is false.\n\n",
