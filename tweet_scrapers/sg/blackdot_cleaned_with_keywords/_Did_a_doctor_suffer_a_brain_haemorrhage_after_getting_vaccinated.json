    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this message being forwarded on WhatsApp:\n\nThe content of the message is said to be taken from the Facebook page of an individual named Bun Ngok Fong, the alleged cousin of a gynaecologist and fertility specialist named Dr Ann Tan. The message states that Dr Tan is now being warded in the ICU of Mount Elizabeth Hospital for brain haemorrhage after taking the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The author calls the vaccine \u201cproblematic\u201d.\nThe post also brings up how Pfizer\u2019s CEO Albert Bourla had declined to take the jab himself, and that this \u201csays volumes about the efficacy and reliability of the product which in essence is genetic manipulation\u201d.\nThe WhatsApp user who forwarded the message shared that the link leads to opposition politician Goh Meng Seng\u2019s Facebook page, and that Bun Ngok Fong had hidden his post about Dr Tan. A link to what is allegedly Dr Tan\u2019s clinic\u2019s Facebook page was also shared.\n\nThe Facebook link which is said to lead to the post on Goh\u2019s page is broken, but we were able to find another post on the page where Goh shared a screenshot of the post by Bun Ngok Fong. We also see a comment on the post which claims that the post on Bun Ngok Fong\u2019s page was \u201ctaken down at [Dr Tan\u2019s] husband\u2019s request\u201d. The commenter also voiced suspicions that \u201cMOH gave them pressure (to do so)\u201d.\n\nThere are quite a few claims being made, so let\u2019s summarise them for the sake of clarity:\n\nA Singapore doctor is now warded in ICU for brain haemorrhage after taking the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine\nPfizer\u2019s CEO declined to take the jab, and the vaccine \u201cin essence is genetic manipulation\u201d\nThe EU\u2019s vaccination passport proposal excluding vaccines from Cuba, Russia and China is proof of a ploy to \u201ccompel hesitant candidates to subject themselves to a shortlist of western and still dubious injections\u201d\n\nClaim #1: A Singapore doctor is now warded in ICU for brain haemorrhage after taking the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine\nIn the original post by Bun Ngok Fong, we read that the doctor, Dr Ann Tan, is a gynaecologist and fertility specialist. Doing a quick Google search, we are led to Dr Tan\u2019s clinic\u2019s website, which had this pop-up:\n\nWhen we visited her clinic\u2019s Facebook page, we see the same message posted on 25 March:\n\nIn the comments, we see several individuals wishing her a speedy recovery:\n\nOn 4 April, Mount Elizabeth Hospital took to Facebook to acknowledge that they are aware of a post circulating on Facebook which alleges that one of their doctors \u201chad a severe reaction a week after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine\u201d.\n\nThe hospital clarified that the allegations in the post are untrue and that \u201cthe doctor\u2019s family has also confirmed that the writer is not related to them and has written to Facebook to have the post removed\u201d.\nTherefore, the claim that the author of the post is the doctor\u2019s cousin is not just false, but also undermines the validity of the statements he made.\n\nIt is also false that the doctor had a severe reaction a week after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nHowever, it is uncertain whether or not the doctor had a reaction to the vaccine (although not considered severe) given how she seems to still be unable to see patients at time of publication. We have reached out to Mount Elizabeth Hospital for clarification and will update the post when we get a reply.\nClaim #2: Pfizer\u2019s CEO declined to take the jab, and the vaccine \u201cin essence is genetic manipulation\u201d\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC back on 14 December 2020 that he had not received his company\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine shot, citing that he and other executives will not \u201ccut the line\u201d as the US kicked off vaccination distribution efforts across the country. Due to limited doses available then, the CDC had recommended states prioritise healthcare workers and long-term care residents, and Bourla said that due to him not being a frontline healthcare worker himself and being in relatively good health, it was not entirely appropriate for him to receive the vaccine before those who needed it more.\nIn a fact-check by USA TODAY which looked into a\u00a0video on Facebook published on 24 March with the caption \u201c#Pfeizer CEO Refuses to get COVID Vaccine\u201d, we see Pfizer spokeswoman Sharon Castillo saying that the report is \u201ccategorically false\u201d, and that \u201cDr. Bourla has been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine\u201d.\nWe also see a tweet from Bourla himself on 11 March in which he said he was \u201cexcited to receive [his] 2nd dose\u201d of the vaccine.\n\nExcited to receive my 2nd dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech #COVID19 vaccine. There's nothing I want more than for my loved\u00a0ones and people around the world to have the same opportunity. Although the journey is far from over, we are working tirelessly to beat the virus. pic.twitter.com/ES05WPBLJA\n\u2014 AlbertBourla (@AlbertBourla) March 10, 2021\n\nTherefore, while Pfizer\u2019s CEO Albert Bourla declined to take the jab in the initial stages when supply of the vaccine was low, the claim that he is still not vaccinated because of perhaps his lack of faith in his company\u2019s product is false.\n\nAs for the claim that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is \u201cgenetic manipulation\u201d, it is uncertain if the author is referring to how it might be able to alter human DNA, or if he is referring to how there is a manipulation of genes/DNA (science fact: genes are made up of DNA) that goes into the making of these vaccines.\nFor the former,\u00a0the claim that Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s vaccine can alter human DNA has already been debunked late last year by multiple fact-checkers (including us).\nFor those who require a quick refresher, there is no evidence that mRNA vaccines (which Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have developed) can alter human DNA. To quote Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at Cornell University\u2019s Alliance for Science group who spoke to Reuters: \u201cGenetic modification would involve the deliberate insertion of foreign DNA into the nucleus of a human cell, and vaccines simply don\u2019t do that.\u201d\nAs to whether or not there is a manipulation of genes/DNA that goes into the making of the vaccine, we refer once again to Lynas, who wrote an article in December titled: \u201cYes, some COVID vaccines use genetic engineering. Get over it.\u201d\nIn the article, he writes that \u201ca variant of the mRNA approach is to go one step back in the process and construct a vaccine platform out of DNA\u201d. However, he writes that this doesn\u2019t mean that this DNA can genetically engineer a human\u2019s cells. He explained: \u201cDNA is injected in little circular pieces called \u201cplasmids\u201d \u2014 not to be confused with plastics \u2014 and while these do enter the nucleus, the new DNA does not integrate into your cellular genome.\u201d\nTherefore, while it is true that there is genetic engineering happening in the development of some COVID-19 vaccines, the insinuation that this leads to the altering of human DNA is false.\n\nClaim #3: The EU\u2019s vaccination passport proposal excluding vaccines from Cuba, Russia and China is proof of a ploy to \u201ccompel hesitant candidates to subject themselves to a shortlist of western and still dubious injections\u201d\nOn 17 March, the\u00a0European Commission proposed to create a \u2018Digital Green Certificate\u2019 that would facilitate safe free movement inside the EU pandemic. The Certificate would be \u201cproof that a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result or recovered from COVID-19\u201d and will be available in digital or paper format for free.\nIt is important to note that it is mentioned that the Digital Green Certificate will benefit \u201call people \u2013 vaccinated and non-vaccinated\u201d when travelling in the EU. This is emphasised in the Q&A page for the Certificate:\n\nWe also read that the Digital Green Certificate will be able to serve as proof of vaccination, testing and recovery, and this will help waive restrictions to free movement of individuals put in place in a Member State, such as testing or quarantine requirements. If a Member State accepts proof of vaccination to waive restrictions to free movement, it will have to accept proof of vaccination issued by another Member State in relation to vaccines which have received EU market authorisation.\nThese are currently the vaccines that have received EU market authorisation, and those which are currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA):\n\nIn the list, we do not see China\u2019s Sinovac or Sinopharm, but we see Russia\u2019s Sputnik V.\nIt is also important to note that Member States will have the option to extend this privilege to travellers who receive other vaccines.\nWhile it is uncertain which other vaccines (like those from Sinovac or Sinopharm) would be accepted by Member States, it is premature to insinuate that the terms in the EU vaccination passport/Digital Green Certificate would purposefully exclude vaccines from countries like China, Cuba and Russia and that this is proof of a ploy to push individuals to \u201csubject themselves to a shortlist of western and still dubious injections\u201d.\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\n",
