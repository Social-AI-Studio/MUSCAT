    "Paragraphs": "\n\nYou may have come across this video claiming that a fight involving large numbers of Myanmar and Chinese shipyard workers had taken place at the Keppel shipyard canteen.\n\nThe allegation is untrue. No fight took place in Keppel shipyard between Chinese and Myanmar workers.\n\nWe did a reverse image search to see if there were other sources for the image and found several citing the same news.\u00a0 We have found nothing from official sources or otherwise, claiming that the incident happened in Keppel shipyard as alleged.\n\u00a0\nThese sources stated that the video showed an incident that took place on 12 September 2019, in the Amur region in Russia, between workers of the Amur Gas Processing Plant.\u00a0 In a statement allegedly by the press service of the Amur Gas Processing Plant:-\n\u201cSeptember 12 in the morning in the dining room of one of the contractors there was an incident on household soil.\u00a0One of the workers entered into a verbal skirmish with his colleague, after which the conflict escalated into a brawl, in which 8 people took part.\u00a0All participants were detained by police.\u00a0The internal affairs authorities are checking the causes of the conflict.\u00a0There were no casualties from the incident.\u201d\nGiven the fact that there are numerous different Russian news sources reporting the same matter and reporting the same statement above, it appears likely that the incident did indeed take place in Russia.\u00a0 We have found nothing else to refute this.\nSee the various reports we chanced upon here, here and here.\nThe Singapore Police Force has issued a Facebook post confirming that the incident did not take place in Singapore as claimed.\u00a0 They have however, not confirmed if the incident actually took place in Amur, Russia.\u00a0 See below for further information.\n\n",
