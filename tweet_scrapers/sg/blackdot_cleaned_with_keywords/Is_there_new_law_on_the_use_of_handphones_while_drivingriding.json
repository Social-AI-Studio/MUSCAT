    "Paragraphs": "\nOn 13 February 2019, we were alerted to the attached circulating Whatsapp message. It claims that new law has been passed so that if you\u2019re caught using a mobile phone while driving, or even if the vehicle is stationary, you would lose your licence immediately, for a period of 3 months.\n\nThis is fake news.\n\n\nIf you come across it, let your friends/family know that this is untrue. Please note that this had previously been called out by the press.\n\n",
