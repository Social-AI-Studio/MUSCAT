    "Paragraphs": "\n\n\nOn 30 September 2019, the Daily Mail and the Sun reported that a schoolgirl from Kazakhstan had died after a phone charging next to her exploded.\u00a0 The reports were carried on local alternative media site \u201cMothership\u201d.\nAccording to the various reports, Alua Asetkyzy Abzalbek, 14 years old, had gone to bed listening to music from her phone in her village home in Bastobe, Kazakhstan.\nThe above picture is from The Sun newspaper, which published the picture with a caption stating that Alua had been found dead after her mobile phone battery apparently burst into flames:-\n\nNow the story about Alua is sadly, real.\u00a0 We have found various independent sources confirming that she had indeed passed away as a result of the accident involving her mobile phone.\nHowever, we cannot say the same about the above incriminating picture.\u00a0 Many news outlets have interpreted the above picture from the Sun to mean that the phone in the picture was Alua\u2019s phone which had burst into flames. This however is not true, and the picture shown may have been illustrative of what the actual phone could have looked like.\nWe regard the picture as misleading.\nThe picture shown seems have come from an online forum in Russia.\u00a0 See here and here.\nThe image we found was obtained through a reverse image search performed on Google Image Search.\u00a0 We tracked for the earliest date for the image and came across the following link dated 7 January 2014.\nAccording to a forum poster by the name of mrlong on the Russian forum yuplakal.com, in 2014, mrlong\u2019s phone caught fire from the lithium ion battery malfunctioning.\u00a0 The phone did not explode, but released a large amount of smoke.\n\nDoes it matter?\nWell it does, because good reporting should not use misleading images to \u2018spice up\u2019 the story, which appears to be the case here.\u00a0 If there had not been any picture of the phone to begin with, there was no reason to have put in any picture of a burnt phone, let alone a phone that did not actually explode and cause any death or injury.\nWhat\u2019s safe and what\u2019s not?\nIf you are thinking that there\u2019s a risk of overcharging by leaving your phone to charge overnight, you\u2019d be wrong. Your phone stops drawing power upon being fully charged.\u00a0 So it does not overcharge.\nThe risk of fire comes from using either a battery or charger that hasn\u2019t been certified safe for use with your device.\u00a0 Watch this CNA short video to learn more:\n\n",
