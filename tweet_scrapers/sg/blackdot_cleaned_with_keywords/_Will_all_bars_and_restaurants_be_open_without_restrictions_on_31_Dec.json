    "Paragraphs": "\nWe\u2019ve been alerted to a message being forwarded on WhatsApp:\n\nAccording to the message, the Singapore government confirmed that \u201call bars and restaurants can open without restrictions\u201d to celebrate the new year. The message also curiously includes two links \u2013 one to CNA\u2019s front page, another to what seems to be an external preview link on Reddit.\nGiven that F&B establishments are currently still operating under strict restrictions, does the author of the WhatsApp message know some insider information that the rest of us don\u2019t?\nWell, while the first link\u00a0does lead to CNA\u2019s front page, here\u2019s what the latter leads to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Warning: Readers who are sensitive to simian-related profanity should be prepared for potentially upsetting content.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nThe prankster who crafted the message probably decided that the inclusion of a legitimate news website in the message would bait more members of the public into clicking the second link.\nNeedless to say, the claim is false and can even be called satire.\n\n",
