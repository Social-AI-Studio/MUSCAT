    "Paragraphs": "\nYesterday (6 February), screenshots from Instagram user @sohyasauce\u2019s account were posted on Facebook page Zongino.\n\nIf one were to ignore the text saying \u2018fresh bat meat\u2019, you would have mistaken it to be a photo of a packet of chilled meat that you could get from a regular supermarket.\nLook closer, though, and you\u2019ll notice a few details:\n\nThe FairPrice logo\nThe Healthier Choice symbol\nThe $20.20 price tag\nThe write-up on the novel coronavirus\n\nIn the original Instagram post (which has now been removed) by the image\u2019s creator, his caption reveals that he \u201cmade this in the name of fun\u201d and in a moment of prophecy, \u201cdon\u2019t attac mi\u201d.\n\nAt time of publication, the Zongino post has garnered 63 reactions, 15 comments, and 145 shares.\nWhile some have called it \u201ccreative\u201d and found it funny, some have called it \u201cterrible\u201d and that it was done in \u201cbad taste\u201d \u2013 pun not intended.\nWith their name on the line, NTUC FairPrice themselves have come forward to address the post, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d and stating that it\u2019s a \u201cwilful act of mischief\u201d and \u201cis especially insensitive given the current 2019 Novel Coronavirus situation\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nFake News Alert: We understand an image of bat being sold under our FairPrice Pasar label has been circulating on social\u2026\nPosted by NTUC FairPrice on\u00a0Thursday, 6 February 2020\n\nFairPrice also advised individuals to avoid circulating the image, \u201cto avoid any unnecessary confusion and offence\u201d.\nRegardless, it\u2019s pretty obvious that the post as satire, whether or not you find it intelligent or insensitive.\n\nWhat do you think about the image? Let us know!\n",
