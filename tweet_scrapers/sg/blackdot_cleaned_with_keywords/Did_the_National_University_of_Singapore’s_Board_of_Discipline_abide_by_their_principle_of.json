    "Paragraphs": "\n\n(Edit: The Singapore Police Force has given written clarifications on the earlier figures reported by various media outlets.\u00a0 These describe the number of sexual offences which were prosecuted or given a conditional warning, relying on the NUS BOD\u2019s figures revealed in academic years 15/16, 16/17 and 17/18.\nThe clarifications do not affect our article below, as we were focused on how the NUS BOD determined punishment for multiple offences and whether they had kept in line with their stated policy of \u201c2 strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d.\u00a0 This is unrelated to how the police performed their investigations.\u00a0 However, we thought alerting you to these articles would be important for you to form your own views on this matter.\nSee the Straits Times\u2019 article here. See CNA\u2019s clarification on a particular case here.)\n\u00a0\nThis is a follow up to the Monica Baey saga.\u00a0 Our earlier articles on this topic are found here and here.\nOn 22 April 2019, the Straits Times reported that the National University of Singapore had a policy for sexual misconduct cases, which, as described by NUS vice-provost (student life) Florence Ling, was that a student who had been found guilty of sexual misconduct for a second time would be expelled.\u00a0 According to her:\n\u201cFor first-time offenders, because we are an educational institution, we want to give the students a chance. Student offenders who appear before the Board of Discipline for the first time are given a range of punishments, but not immediate expulsion\u201d\nHowever, and as further reported, she said that students involved in multiple sexual misconduct incidents outside NUS who are caught by the university, even for the first time, will be expelled.\nAssuming that the ST article reported the matter accurately, the above policy has not been applied.\nA contradiction picked up by the Straits Times\nOn 24 April 2019, the Straits Times published a second article, questioning if the stated policy had been followed.\nAs stated by the Straits Times:-\n\nOver the past 3 years (it is unclear if they are referring to academic years, which would split across calendar years), 26 cases of sexual offences were brought before the NUS disciplinary board.\n18 cases involved sexual voyeurism, with some students taking upskirt videos and photographs, or filming both male and female students showering.\n5 cases involved outrage of modesty, or touching the thighs or buttocks of female students.\nThe last 3 were a mix of acts such as harassment via text messages or calls of a sexual nature and indecent exposure.\nSeparately there were another 3 cases of trespassing and theft of female undergarments from hostels.\nOf the 26 sexual misconduct cases and 3 theft cases, 16 involved police investigations, which led to sentences such as imprisonment for as long as 16 weeks, supervised probation and community service.\nSeparately 17 cases ended with the student being suspended from school for mostly one to two semesters.\nNone of the students were expelled, even when they had committed multiple acts of sexual misconduct. There were 13 of such cases.\n\nIs the report of the Straits Times true in respect of the issue of zero expelled students (even for multiple acts of sexual misconduct)?\nYes, it appears to be substantially true.\n\nWe are unable to definitively say that it is completely true because in at least 1 case (Academic Year 16/17, cases no. 36 and 37 involving the same student) the NUS BOD had expelled the student, but later, as a result of a successful appeal, the student was reinstated.\u00a0 That is, at best, evidence of an attempted application of the policy.\nWe have seen the documents disclosed by the Facebook group \u201cNUS Students United\u201d, found here:\n\nThe documents show the decisions of the NUS BOD over 3 academic years.\u00a0 The correctness of the list has not been disputed as far as we can tell.\u00a0 As mentioned in our earlier factcheck as well, we take the view that this is a credible source document, and we note further that the Straits Times appears to have relied on the same documents.\nWe arrived at a different count from the Straits Times, but this is a minor difference of 1 case, which could be an issue of interpreting the way the tables set out the cases.\u00a0 We also need to emphasise that in analysing the documents, we had to make certain assumptions about how the BOD approached each case.\n\nAs we reviewed the documents, we assumed that the University BOD considered offences which took place in a continuous manner or sufficiently close together (e.g. trespassing into a toilet and then filming, or taking a video and then sharing it) as one entire offence.\nWe also assumed that the \u201csecond strike\u201d offence had to be related to committing sexual misconduct against a female (i.e. an offence such as viewing obscene material alone would not fall within the category of a \u201csecond strike\u201d).\n\nWe achieved a count of 12 cases, which we set out below.\n\u00a0\nAcademic Year 15/16\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n17.\nStudent had harassed several female students from NUS hostels and insulted the modesty of a woman by uttering obscenities to her over the phone. He also perpetuated the harassment of a female by editing a photograph of her and uploading it onto the Internet. In addition, he had stolen female undergarments from NUS hostels.\nPolice Case: Student was sentenced to 18 months of supervised probation.\n\u00a0\nThe student was:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 suspended from his candidature until the end of Semester 2 AY2015/16 (two semesters);\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 deemed ineligible to be granted any form of on-campus housing and barred from all on-campus housing premises for the remaining period of his candidature;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mandated for counselling and assessment;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mandated to submit a Letter of Apology to the victim of the offences;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fined S$1,000/-; and\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 issued an official reprimand.\n\n\n26.\nStudent had trespassed into a female toilet and peeped at a female student as she was showering. Student was also found in possession of women\u2019s clothing and undergarments at that time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPolice Case: Student\u2019s case was still under Police investigation when the BOD took place. Student\u2019s case is currently pending recommendations\u00a0 by the Attorney-General Chambers.\n\u00a0\nThe BOD made the interim decision (which was later extended for another three months) that the student:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 had his case reviewed pending the outcome of the Attorney-General Chambers, or after a period of three months from the date of the interim decision by the BOD;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 was deemed ineligible to be granted any form of on-campus housing and barred from all on-campus housing premises during the interim period; and\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mandated to continue with psychological treatment.\n\n\n29.\nStudent had filmed a female student as she was showering.\nPolice Case: Student\u2019s case was still under Police investigation when the BOD took place. Student was eventually issued a 24-month conditional warning in lieu of prosecution by the Police.\n\u00a0\nThe BOD made the interim decision (which was later extended for another three months) that the student:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 had his case reviewed pending the outcome of the police investigations, or after a period of three months from the date of the interim decision by the BOD;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 was deemed ineligible to be granted any form of University on-campus housing and be barred from all on-campus housing premises during this interim period;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 was mandated for counselling and psychological assessment; and\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 was mandated to write an unreserved Letter of Apology to the victim.\n\u00a0\nIn the interim period, Police investigations revealed that the student had filmed another female student on the same day of the offence. Student\u2019s case was reviewed in AY2016/17 and together with the additional offence, the student was:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 suspended from his candidature with immediate effect until the end of Semester 2, AY2016/17 (two semesters);\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mandated for an assessment with a psychiatrist;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 deemed ineligible to be granted any form of University on-campus housing and barred from all on-campus housing premises for the remaining period of his candidature;\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 fined S$1,000/-; and\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 issued an official reprimand.\n\n\n30.\nStudent had filmed male students while they were showering on multiple occasions and uploaded the videos onto pornographic websites.\nPolice Case: Student\u2019s case was still under Police investigation when the BOD took place.

Student had trespassed into female toilets within NUS and filmed females on multiple occasions. Student had also filmed up-skirt videos of females within campus and in public areas.\n\u00a0\nStudent\u2019s first BOD took place in AY2014/15 for only one case of trespassing and filming which was known to the University at that time.\nPolice Case: Student\u2019s court proceedings were still ongoing when the second BOD took place.
