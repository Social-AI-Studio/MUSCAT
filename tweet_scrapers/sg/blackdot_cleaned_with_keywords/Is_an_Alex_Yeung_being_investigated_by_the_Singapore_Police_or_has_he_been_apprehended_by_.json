    "Paragraphs": "\n\n\n\nThe Singapore Police Force\u2019s social media channels are certainly feeling some heat.\u00a0 This is regarding an incident involving one Alex Yeung, a Hong Kong resident, whose passport has been impounded in Singapore, pending investigations.\n\nNow Alex Yeung is a pro-China supporter, and his popular views regarding the ongoing HK protests have earned him both praise and contempt alike.\nIn the online space, it appears that many are suggesting that he has been wrongfully arrested by the Singapore Police and are actively encouraging taking steps to \u201cpressure\u201d the Singapore government into releasing him.\u00a0 See some of these views here:\n\n[\u8acb\u63a8\u7206] \u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u99d0\u6e2f\u9818\u4e8bFacebook\u8fce\u6551\u83ef\u8a18\u884c\u52d5\n\u8acb\u5230\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u9818\u4e8bfacebook\u4ee5\u611b\u56fd\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u8072\u63f4\u83ef\u8a18Alex Yeung\n\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u641e\u5927\u4f62\u5148\u6551\u5230\u4f62\u5440\n\u4f8b:\n\u72af\u6211\u4e2d\u534e\uff0c\u867d\u8fdc\u5fc5\u8bdb\u3002\n\u58f0\u63f4\u7231\u56fd\u534e\u8bb0\u3002\n\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u56fd\uff0c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u4eba\u90fd\u5403\u7caa\u4fbf\u4e86\uff01\u5feb\u653e\u7231\u56fd\u534e\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e0d\u7136\u4e2d\u56fd\u5fc5\u7136\u5f3a\u70c8\u53cd\u5236\u3002https://t.co/BV0o6y51fL pic.twitter.com/7b7yUOeGbh\n\u2014 83 \u5730\u7344\u91cc\u7684\u5929\u4f7f 23 (@JTPXLBKFcDzbRWX) 5 November 2019\n\n\n(See the link here)\n\nThe above views are misleading for suggesting that Alex has been arrested, or that he will go to jail.\nAs per the SPF\u2019s clarification, they have said that:\n\u201cCurrently, Yeung\u2019s passport has been impounded while he is assisting the Police with ongoing investigations. He is, however, neither arrested nor in Police custody, and is free to go about his activities within Singapore.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe also add that Alex has said himself on his Youtube channel that he has not been arrested, and he is merely undergoing investigations.\u00a0 In his latest video, Alex has urged supporters not to drag the matter out as being a problem of the Singapore government or even the Chinese government.\u00a0 The matter has nothing to do with either government (presumably relating to their position in respect of the HK riots), and he is assisting with investigations \u2013 as agreed by him, in his own words.\u00a0 We note that Alex mentions that he is not turning to the Chinese embassy in Singapore for any assistance.\n\n[Update: On 21 November, it has been reported that the Singapore Police Force (SPF) has issued a stern warning to Alex Yeung for organising a public assembly without a police permit. He has subsequently been repatriated and banned from entering the country unless prior permission is obtained.]\n\u00a0\n",
