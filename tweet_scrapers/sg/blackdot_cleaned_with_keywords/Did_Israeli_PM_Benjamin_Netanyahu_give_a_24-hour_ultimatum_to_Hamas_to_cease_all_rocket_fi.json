    "Title": "Did Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu give a 24-hour ultimatum to Hamas to cease \u201call rocket fire\u201d?  ",
    "Tags": [],
    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this post on the Facebook page of retired Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan. Given that the post has been taken down at time of writing, here is a screenshot of it:\n\nThe post contains a transcript of a speech that was allegedly made by the Israeli Prime Minister in front of the Knesset, the legislative branch of the Israeli government. The speech, addressed to \u201cthe leaders and operatives of Hamas\u201d along with its leader Ismail Haniya, gives Hamas a 24-hour ultimatum to cease \u201call rocket fire\u201d. The speech also gives \u201cformal notice\u201d that Israeli tanks are \u201cmassed at the Gaza border, with artillery and air support at the ready\u201d.\nThe emergence of the post is especially worrying as it comes at a time when the Israel-Palestine conflict has, in recent weeks, been escalating rapidly.\nDoes this mean that there is any truth in the post, then?\nOn 12 May, Snopes published a factcheck on the speech and noted that it was neither delivered by Netanyahu recently nor delivered by him at all. In fact, the similar text had first started circulating all the way back in 2014. Interestingly, the speech was shared both as an\u00a0 \u201copen letter\u201d to Hamas, and an as a speech delivered in front of the Knesset.\nSnopes traced the origin of the speech back to a post on blog \u201csgb free thought\u201d published on 8 July 2014. The post ended with the line \u201cand then I awoke, and it was all a dream\u201d, suggesting that it could very well be a work of fiction by Shaul B., author and owner of the blog.\nA comment on the post dated 11 July 2014 informs Shaul B. that the text had been spread as a genuine speech made by Netanyahu:\n\nAnother comment posted 5 years later, on 6 May 2019, informs the author that the speech was \u201cstill being passed around on Facebook\u201d and that the page he/she found it on already had over 450 shares:\n\nIt was only recently on 13 May 2021 that Shaul B. came out to clarify that the speech was essentially a \u201cmonster\u201d he had created in 2014.\n\u201cI wrote a work of viral fake-news, completely unintentionally,\u201d he said.\nAdmitting that he feels \u201ca kind of guilty pride\u201d about how his work of fiction had seemed to have \u201cclearly touched and resonated with a huge number of people\u201d, he goes on to describe the speech as a monster that makes an appearance \u201cevery time Israel goes into yet another round of fighting with Hamas\u201d.\nTherefore, it is false that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu recently made a speech in front of the Knesset giving Hamas a 24-hour ultimatum.\n\n",
