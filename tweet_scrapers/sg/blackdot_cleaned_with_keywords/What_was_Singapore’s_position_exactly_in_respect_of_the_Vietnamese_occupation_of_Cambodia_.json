    "Paragraphs": "\n\n\nOn 26 May 2019, the former Prime Minister of Thailand and president of the Privy Council of Thailand, Prem Tinsulanonda, passed away.\u00a0 He was 98 years old.\nSingapore\u2019s Prime Minister, PM Lee, penned the following post on 31 May 2019, expressing his condolences and admiration for the former Thai PM:\n\nIn giving his condolences, PM Lee mentioned the former Thai PM\u2019s contribution towards ASEAN\u2019s condemnation of Vietnam\u2019s invasion of Cambodia and the Cambodian government which replaced the Pol Pot regime in end-1978.\u00a0 This sparked anger in Vietnam and Cambodia.\nWhat was their anger about? In gist, Vietnamese and Cambodians angered by PM Lee\u2019s post disagreed that Vietnam had invaded Cambodia in 1978.\u00a0 They preferred to say that Vietnam had liberated Cambodia from the Pol Pot regime.\nThe above is amply clear from various comments on PM Lee\u2019s Facebook post, such as the following one:\n\nCambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen penned a strongly worded Facebook post on 7 June 2019, in response to PM Lee\u2019s post, stating that:\n\nVietnam had not invaded, but had liberated the Cambodian people.\n\n\nSingapore supported the genocidal Pol Pot regime.\n\n\nSingapore was the host of a tripartite meeting that led to the formation of the Coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea, which prolonged the Cambodia-Vietnam war and the suffering of Cambodian people for 10 years thereafter.\n\n\nThe Cambodian Prime Minister is clearly not alone in giving these views.\u00a0 The Cambodian newspaper, the Khmer Times, shared the same views in a recent article, see\u00a0here.\nWe examine each claim below.\nClaim 1: Vietnam had not invaded, but had liberated the Cambodian people\nThis claim is misleading because the claim cherry picks the facts.\n\nThe undisputed truth is that in 1978, Vietnam had a hostile relationship with China and Cambodia (which was pro-China).\u00a0 Instead, Vietnam wanted to get rid of Cambodia\u2019s anti-Vietnam government, and as a corollary effect, it ended the Pol Pot regime.\nVerification of this Claim\n\u00a0Several sources make clear that it was not true that Vietnam sought to liberate the Cambodian people in its invasion of 25 December 1978.\n\u00a0Pre-invasion \u2013 The 1970s\nBack in the 1970s, the picture of Southeast Asia was quite different from how it looks today.\u00a0 In essence, it was much less friendly.\nVietnam had become entirely communist by the end of the Vietnam War in April 1975, and also had the strongest military in Southeast Asia, having a one-million strong army that had been battle hardened by the Vietnam War. Singapore was certainly wary of Vietnam.\u00a0 As described in \u201cSingapore, ASEAN and the Cambodian Conflict 1978-1991\u201d, NUS Press Singapore, 2013, Ang Cheng Guan (Ang), Ang quotes the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew in describing this relationship:\n\u201cLee Kuan Yew recalled that Singapore-Vietnam relations did not begin well. According to Lee,\n\u201cthe Vietnamese cunningly exploited the fears and desires of the countries of ASEAN that wanted to befriend them. They talked tough over their radio and newspapers. I found their leaders insufferable. They were filled with their own importance, and prided themselves as the Prussians of Southeast Asia\u2026 They were confident they could beat any other power in the world, even China, if it interfered with Vietnam.\u00a0 For us, the puny states of Southeast Asia, they had nothing but contempt.\u201d\u201d\nCambodia had serious internal struggles. Prior to 1970, it was known as the Kingdom of Cambodia, legitimately ruled by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. In 1970, the Prince was deposed in a limited coup by the existing premier.\u00a0 This was considered by the international community as an internal Cambodian matter, and that there was essentially no change to the government.\u00a0 The Prince went on to ally himself with the Khmer Rouge in order to counter-attack and seize power.\u00a0 When later in April 1975, the Khmer Rouge seized power, they kept the Prince as a symbolic Head of State (until his resignation in 1976), and the Khmer Rouge relied on him to legitimize the government, which made itself known to the international community as Democratic Kampuchea.\u00a0 It was during this time that Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge, let his regime commit acts of genocide and grievous human rights abuses, reducing the Cambodian people from 7 million to around 5 million.\u00a0 In spite of the political turmoil Cambodia underwent, its Khmer Rouge government, i.e. Democratic Kampuchea, was recognized internationally as the legitimate government of Cambodia.\nPrior to 1978, Cambodia and Vietnam did not have good relations, to say the least.\u00a0 In April 1977, a Vietnamese attack on Cambodia had occurred, costing several lives on both sides. Seeing Cambodia as a proxy state of China, Vietnam also later came to view China as an enemy, and allied itself closely with the Soviet Union.\nThe worsening ties between Cambodia, Vietnam and China eventually led to the invasion of Cambodia, as Ang describes (page 13):\n\u201cWithout going too far back into history, Vietnam\u2019s relations with both Kampuchea (Cambodia) and China began to further deteriorate soon after April 1975. Vietnam-Kampuchea territorial disputes became so bad that following a massive Vietnamese attack on Kampuchea\u2019s eastern frontier zone in December 1977, Phnom Penh severed diplomatic relations with Vietnam on 31 December 1977.\u00a0 Beijing was clearly on the side of the Khmer Rouge.\u00a0 \u2026 Phnom Penh, not wanting to have two large and unfriendly neighbours at the same time, was also making efforts to improve relations with Bangkok.\u00a0 The Thais had the difficult task of improving relations with both Kampuchea and Vietnam; and at the same time remaining neutral in the Vietnam Kampuchea conflict\u2026. On 22 January 1978, Beijing, whose relations with Hanoi can at best be described as \u201ccool\u201d since the last few years of the Vietnam War, denounced Hanoi over its border war with Kampuchea. Sino-Vietnamese relations quickly deteriorated further.\u00a0 Differences over Kampuchea triggered many latent differences between both countries. On 12 May 1978, Beijing announced a partial aid-cut to Vietnam. \n\u2026\nBy 3 July, Beijing had cancelled all aid and recalled all Chinese specialists from Vietnam.\u00a0 In July 1978 at the 4th Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, China and Kampuchea were both identified as the immediate enemies of Vietnam.\u201d\n\u00a0The cause for the invasion\nVarious sources we have found indicate that, given the above relationships, Vietnam was looking to strike Cambodia when China couldn\u2019t help Cambodia, and this strike was purely political, having nothing to do with alleviating the suffering at the hands of the Pol Pot regime.\nAs Ang describes:\n\u201cOn 3 November 1978, Vietnam and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. According to Soviet sources, with the signing of the Treaty \u2013 A sign of official support from Moscow, the Vietnamese began to assert that \u201cthe forthcoming dry season can be effectively used for powerful attack on the Phnom Penh regime\u201d.\u00a0 The Vietnamese assured their Soviet Counterparts, who were concerned about Chinese response, that Beijing would not have time to dispatch forces to rescue the Pol Pot regime. \u2026\u201d\nAccording to German Historian Bernd Schaefer, as reported in the Khmer Times on 7 August 2014: (see here)\n\u201c\u201cFrom the East German files I have seen, from early 1978 on, the Vietnamese were committed to replace him, to get rid of Pol Pot, and to get a sympathetic government in Phnom Penh,\u201d said Schaefer. \u201cIn Hanoi\u2019s eyes, a government friendly to Vietnam was absolutely essential to the security of Vietnam.\u00a0\u2026 \nAnd, he added, the Vietnamese did not attack the Khmer Rouge for humanitarian reasons.\n\u201cThey did not primarily act because they wanted to end the genocide,\u2019 Schaefer said, referring to the Khmer Rouge rule. During nearly four years in power, Khmer Rouge implemented policies that killed about one quarter of Cambodia\u2019s population. \u201cThey wanted to get rid of an anti-Viet Nam government, and put in a pro-Viet Nam government. And in doing so, they got rid of the Khmer Rouge government. And that is a fact.\u201d\nPost-Invasion \u2013 The lack of support for Vietnam\nOn 25 December 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia with a 150,000 strong invasion force. The Khmer Rouge military in Cambodia was unable to resist the invasion and lost control of Cambodia.\u00a0 On 8 January 1979, the Vietnamese installed government announced the formation of the Khmer People\u2019s Revolutionary Party.\nIt is important to point out the extent of backlash Vietnam suffered in the international space for its invasion.\nOn 9 and 12 January 1979, ASEAN issued statements to deplore the Vietnamese invasion, calling it \u201carmed intervention against the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea\u201d. \u00a0In particular, the 12 January 1979 statement impliedly pointed out that Vietnam had lied by going back on its earlier pledge to respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, called for the total and immediate withdrawal of Vietnam\u2019s forces, and also welcomed UN intervention in the matter.\u00a0 See the 12 January 1979 statement here.\nBetween 11 and 15 January 1979, the UN Security Council (UNSC) convened in New York at the request of Democratic Kampuchea.\u00a0 A draft resolution was tabled by China to condemn the invasion and demand the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cambodia, but the Soviet Union vetoed the resolution and it could not be passed by the UNSC.\n1979 - PRC - Draft - S_13022-EN\n\u00a0\nOn 17 February 1979, China launched a military invasion into Vietnam \u201cto teach Vietnam a lesson\u201d for its invasion of Cambodia (in the words of the Chinese defence establishment to Lee Kuan Yew).\u00a0 This lasted until withdrawal commenced on 5 March 1979.\u00a0 The real reason for the invasion was so that Vietnam would have to further commit forces to defend its border with China and could not persist further in its invasion of Cambodia. While this was useful to check the progress of Vietnam into Cambodia, it gave ASEAN difficulties because it was opposed to any form of hostile intervention into a country\u2019s affairs, just as the United Nations was.\u00a0 ASEAN did not eventually have to give any statement because once China achieved its objective, it withdrew from Vietnam.\nThe UNSC again tried to resolve to condemn the Vietnamese invasion on 25 to 27 February 1979.\u00a0 Again they failed because of the Soviet Union veto.\n1979 - PRC - Draft 2 - S_13119-EN\n\u00a0\nOn 14 November 1979, success was reached at the UN General Assembly level, with the passing of a resolution at the 34th UNGA which spoke against the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam.\nEventually, after intensive lobbying efforts by the ASEAN nations and with particular effort from Singapore, the international community grew to support ASEAN\u2019s efforts.\nIn 1982, ASEAN succeeded in convincing various factions (including the Khmer Rouge) to form a coalition government of democratic Kampuchea.\u00a0 This coalition government was crucial as it presented a focal point for lobbying efforts at the UN by ASEAN to reject the puppet government installed by Vietnam and recognize the coalition government as the legitimate government.\nAs the late Lee Kuan Yew put it:\n\u201cAt the UN General Assembly in 1982, Sihanouk as president of the newly formed coalition government appealed to UN members to restore Cambodia\u2019s independence and sovereignty.\u00a0 They responded by voting for Democratic Kampuchea with a bigger margin, a total of 105 member states.\u00a0 By gathering more votes in the UN each year, we made the Vietnamese feel their growing isolation.\u201d\nIndeed, the collective efforts of ASEAN had its effect on the United Nations.\u00a0 Every year, ASEAN would sponsor a draft resolution at the UN General Assembly for voting upon.\nThe result of this was that from the 34th UN General Assembly onwards, there would be a resolution sponsored by ASEAN which would effectively imply that Vietnam was an unlawful aggressor, and ought to withdraw from Cambodia.\nVietnam was forced to leave Cambodia due to economic difficulties.\u00a0 The late Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew states in \u201cFrom Third World to First The Singapore Story: 1965-2000\u201d at page 379:\n\u201cAs it turned out, the Soviet Union was bleeding from the war in Afghanistan and its massive aid to Vietnam, Ethiopia, Angola and Cuba.\u00a0 By the late 1980s Soviet aid had stopped and Vietnam was in economic difficulties; it had an inflation rate of above 1,000 per cent in 1988 and a food crisis.\u00a0 It had to get out of Cambodia.\u201d\nThis is true. \u00a0In May 1988, Vietnam announced that it would formally commence withdrawal, and it was widely believed that this was because of various other problems (including trade sanctions from the US due to Vietnam\u2019s actions in invading Cambodia).\u00a0 See an American news report on this here.\nIn 1990, UN Resolution 668 was passed, calling for a political settlement of the issues in Cambodia.\u00a0 Later in 1991, the Paris Peace Agreements formally titled Comprehensive Cambodian Peace Agreements were signed on October 23, 1991.\u00a0 This marked the official end of the war.\n00668\n\u00a0\nAfter the final peace agreement was signed, the United Nations despatched an advance peacekeeping force, followed by the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) with a limited objective of holding elections with minimum loss of lives.\nClaims 2 and 3: Singapore supported the Pol Pot Regime and also led the initiative to form the Coalition Government in 1982 which prolonged the war and caused greater suffering in Cambodia.\nAt the heart of both claims is the issue of whether Singapore supported the Pol Pot regime.\u00a0 However, we note that there is ambiguity as to what \u201csupport\u201d means \u2013\n\nIf \u201csupport\u201d means whether Singapore agreed with the genocide that Pol Pot committed, and wanted the Pol Pot regime to continue, that is untrue.\nIf it means that Singapore acknowledged that Democratic Kampuchea was the government having a valid seat at the UN, then it would be correct.\u00a0 And also, the fact that Singapore had a major hand in encouraging ASEAN and different quarters of Cambodia to form the coalition government in 1982 (which Vietnam vehemently rejected).\u00a0 It would further be incorrect to suggest that the coalition government which was formed had caused further suffering and prolonged the war.\u00a0 What prolonged the war was Vietnam refusing to leave and insisting on fighting against anti-Vietnam guerillas which various countries (including Singapore) funded, armed and trained to wage war against the Vietnamese military.\nWhat was Singapore\u2019s position?\nSingapore was more concerned with the possibility of becoming another Cambodia, if Vietnam was left unchecked.\u00a0 As former President SR Nathan states in his book \u201cAn Unexpected Journey, Path to the Presidency\u201d, at pages 384-385, Singapore was well aware of the cruelty that the Pol Pot regime brought to the Cambodians, but as a matter of principle, had no choice but to support them:\n\u201cI had no illusions about the nature of the Khmer Rouge regime.\u00a0 When the takeover took place, I was with the Ministry of Defence, and in my intelligence role there I heard plenty of horror stories about Khmer Rouge brutality.\u00a0 These were confirmed by my colleague from MFA, Lee Chiong Giam, who visited Cambodia \u2026. At the invitation of the Khmer Rouge government.\u00a0 \u2026\u201d\n\u201cAs a small country surrounded by larger neighbours, we felt that the invasion of Cambodia raised issues of principle that were directly relevant to our situation.\u00a0 The Vietnamese had justified themselves on the basis of the need to save the people from Khmer Rouge cruelty. Whatever the nature of the regime, we felt that if a precedent were established justifying invasion on the grounds of internal developments in a country, this eroded our own security.\u00a0 In fact the Vietnam argument was rather spurious \u2013 they were not really bothered about the Khmer Rouge.\u00a0 They were more worried by the fact that China was using the Khmer Rouge to put the brake on their own regional ambitions.\u00a0 We proceeded very carefully.\u201d\nThe late Mr Lee Kuan Yew mentions in his book (\u201cFrom Third World to First The Singapore Story: 1965-2000\u201d at page 374):\n\u201cWhen the Vietnamese were advancing in Cambodia towards its border with Thailand, the situation became dangerous.\u00a0 However, the Chinese punitive expedition against Vietnam in February 1979 stabilised the position.\u00a0 The question then was how to prevent the Heng Samrin regime, installed in Phnom Penh by the Vietnamese, from dislodging Pol Pot\u2019s Khmer Rouge government from its seat in the United Nations.\u00a0 Their genocide of their own people had caused worldwide abhorrence and revulsion against the Khmer Rouge.\u00a0 But if we wanted to keep the Vietnamese from getting international recognition for their puppet regime, we had no choice but to support the Khmer Rouge government.\u201d\nThis position was reflective of the position of ASEAN.\u00a0 As Ang notes from one of the Joint Communiques of ASEAN in June 1980, the Joint Communique reiterated the ASEAN stand that:\n\u201cno regime set up by occupying foreign forces, however it is given the appearance of legitimacy, can satisfy the principles enunciated in the UN Charter\u2026 that the grounds for their support for the credentials of Democratic Kampuchea are based on the fundamental principles of foreign intervention must be opposed and that any change in the recognition of Democratic Kampuchea\u2019s credentials would be tantamount to condoning Vietnamese military intervention.\u201d\nAs described by Prof Tommy Koh in \u201cThe Tommy Koh reader / Favourite Essays and Lectures\u201c, Prof Koh explains ASEAN\u2019s mission (at pages 72 to 73):\n\u201cAs part of my sixth encounter with Cambodia, I was involved in ASEAN\u2019s Cambodian diplomacy, from December 1978 until the signing of the Paris Agreement in 1991.\u00a0 During this long campaign, ASEAN\u2019s objectives were as follows:\n(a) Prevent the Heng Samrin regime (the puppet government installed by Vietnam) \u00a0from occupying Cambodia\u2019s seat at the UN;\n(b) Isolate Vietnam domestically and economically in order to pressure Vietnam\u00a0to come to the negotiating table;\n(c) Persuade the Khmer Rouge; the Cambodian resistance movement led by Sihanouk and his son, Ranariddh; and the resistance movement led by the nationalist, Son Sann; to form a coalition government;\n(d) Help the armed resistance against the Vietnamese to gain traction and prevent the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia from becoming a fait accompli;\n(e) Work closely with the UN Secretary-General, the UN Security Council and the Non-Aligned Movement to persuade Vietnam, and its patron, the Soviet Union, that the only solution to the Cambodian conflict was a negotiated one; and\n(f) Negotiate an international agreement to bring the Cambodian conflict to a peaceful conclusion, to accept the UN as the interim administration of Cambodia, to give the people of Cambodia the right to determine their own future and to restore Cambodia\u2019s sovereignty and independence in a free and fair election.\u201c\nAll the above does not however, indicate that there was any support for the actions of the genocidal regime of Pol Pot / Khmer Rouge.\u00a0 There are 2 reasons to point out.\nFirst, while Singapore rejected the Vietnamese puppet government in Cambodia, it did not want the same Democratic Kampuchea government\u00a0 -Singapore had to prevent the Khmer Rouge from regaining ground once the Vietnamese withdrew.\u00a0 This could only be achieved by pushing for the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea to be formed. \u00a0As SR Nathan stated in his book: (see page 390)\n\u201cHowever, we did see a need to respond to the disastrous reputation that the Khmer Rouge coalition was gaining internationally for the brutality and inhumanity of its regime.\u00a0 The people were being treated appallingly.\u00a0 We feared that unless something was done to change perceptions, the international community would be increasingly disinclined to support Cambodia in the UN and other forums.\u00a0 ASEAN\u2019s defence of the Khmer Rouge government was clearly becoming untenable, and equally it did not share China\u2019s desire to see the Khmer Rouge return to power after the Vietnamese withdrawal. Singapore envisaged, and sought ASEAN\u2019s endorsement of, the creation of a \u2018Third Force\u2019, that would take leadership away from the Khmer Rouge and see it shared with other Cambodian nationalist elements.\u00a0 We needed a credible alternative.\u201d\nThis then formed the impetus for the forming of the Coalition Government in 1982, which Singapore actively engineered.\nThe second thing to point out is the fact that Singapore (and in fact the rest of ASEAN), had taken steps to prevent the Khmer Rouge\u2019s return to power at the first opportunity they got.\u00a0 This opportunity came when in May 1988, Vietnam confirmed a first 50,000 troop withdrawal from Cambodia, indicating that the end of the war was in sight.\u00a0 See here.\nShortly thereafter, \u00a0the UN General Assembly, on 4th November 1988, declared in its resolution that \u201cCambodia must not return to \u201dthe universally condemned policies and practices of a recent past\u201d once the Vietnamese left (see here).\nSingapore had voted clearly in favour of this, thereby showing its stand against any return to power by the Khmer Rouge.\u00a0 This position remains the same today.\n",
