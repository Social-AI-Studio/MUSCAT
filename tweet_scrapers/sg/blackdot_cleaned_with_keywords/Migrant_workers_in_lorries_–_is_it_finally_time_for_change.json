    "Paragraphs": "\nThe issue of migrant workers being ferried in lorries has resurfaced in Singapore, following back-to-back fatal accidents in May. Once again, there are calls by the public and members of parliament to improve migrant worker safety, as well as to prioritise human lives over economic costs. Black Dot Research ran a quick poll to find out Singaporeans\u2019 sentiments on the issue, and found that an overwhelming majority are in favour of strengthening laws and regulations to ensure the well-being of migrant workers as they are being ferried to and from their lodging and worksites.\n\n",
