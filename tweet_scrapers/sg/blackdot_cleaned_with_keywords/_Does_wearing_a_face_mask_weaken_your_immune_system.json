    "Paragraphs": "\nIn this fact-check, we touch on a claim that recently went viral on social media, mostly in the US. According to the claim, wearing a face mask will weaken one\u2019s immune system in the long run.\nHere are two examples of the post (with over 31,000 shares combined) being shared, as seen on a fact-check done by AFP.\n\n\nFor context, rules surrounding mask-wearing vary from state to state in the US, though the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that it \u201crecommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings and when around people who don\u2019t live in [their] household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain\u201d.\nMore recently, the claim was also posted on Australian professional boxer Anthony Mundine\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nIn his post, Mundine mentions that wearing a mask \u201ccompromises [the] immune system\u201d and goes so far as to suggest that \u201cthe government [wants] you to get sick so they can manipulate the numbers even more\u201d.\nThe page has over 88,000 followers.\nFor context in this example, the Australian Government\u2019s Department of Health stated in an article published earlier in July that \u201cface masks are now either required or recommended in Victoria (depending on where you live) because of the higher rates of community transmission of coronavirus\u201d. In a more recent update, the wearing of face masks when outside of home will also be made mandatory for all Victorians from midnight of 2 August.\nMask on, common sense on\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO)\u2019s stance on mask-wearing is that masks \u201cshould be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives\u201d, but acknowledges that the use of a mask alone is \u201cnot sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19\u201d.\nIt also recommends that governments should encourage the general public to wear a fabric mask in the event where there is widespread community transmission, and where physical distancing cannot be maintained.\nAs for the claim that the wearing of face masks weakens the immune systems, countless of articles and healthcare professionals have come forward to debunk it.\nAn article on the American Lung Association states that \u201cthere is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system\u201d, and an article by Dr Daniela Lamas, a pulmonary and critical-care doctor, also echoes that sentiment.\nSaid Dr Lamas: \u201cWhile some might object that what we don\u2019t know can still hurt us, there\u2019s no reason to invent new problems when we\u2019re already dealing with real ones, and that\u2019s precisely what those who worry about the effects of masks on our immune systems are doing.\u201d\nIn the fact-check published by AFP, Professor Guy Marks, a respiratory physician and epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales, had told AFP in an email that: \u201cWearing a face mask prevents us from infecting others and reduces the risk of acquiring infection. It has no other effects, including no direct effects on the immune system.\u201d\nThe CDC has even recommended that those who are \u201cimmunocompromised\u201d (those with conditions and treatments that weaken their immune system) wear face masks as a step to protect themselves from COVID-19.\nIt is therefore not certain where these individuals got their \u201cresearch\u201d or \u201cproven science\u201d from. We rate the claim that face masks weaken the immune system as likely false.\n\n",
