    "Paragraphs": "\nFollowing our earlier factcheck on the allegation that Sim Wong Hoo stepped down from Creative as Chief Executive Officer, on 4 April 2019, we have come across another article circulating claiming the above-captioned content.\n\nPlease note that this is completely fake news.\n\n1. The website purporting to be CNN Tech is, in fact, an advertising platform for a business called \u201cBitcoin Rush\u201d which deals in Bitcoin. We have tested every link and note that each link on the website takes one to the Bitcoin Rush page.\n2. There is no news in fact on the legalisation of Bitcoin in Malaysia or investments made by Lim Guan Eng. The actual CNN website does not carry any such news.\n3. We have also noticed no developments on any Malaysian government websites of a similar nature.\nFinally, take note that this fake news is likely to pop up when one surfs on Malaysian websites.\n\n\n",
