    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this message being forwarded on WhatsApp:\n\nThe message includes a link to an article on website National File. The article quotes a report titled \u201cCOVID-19 RNA Based Vaccines and the Risk of Prion Disease\u201d written by a particular J. Bart Classen.\nThere is quite a bit of jargon in the report but essentially what Classen claims is that his analysis found that messenger RNA (mRNA) in the Pfizer vaccine could lead to prion diseases or neurological diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s disease and ALS.\nWhile most of us are familiar with Alzheimer\u2019s and ALS, prion diseases might not be as familiar a term.\nPrion diseases, as described by the CDC, are a family of rare progressive neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals. \u2018Prions\u2019 are abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are able to induce abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins called prion proteins. Some examples of prion diseases are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), more commonly known as \u2018mad cow disease\u2019. Prion diseases are usually rapidly progressive and always fatal.\nIn his report, Classen writes that mRNA vaccines like Pfizer\u2019s have the potential to trigger the abnormal folding of proteins TDP-43 and FUS which are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s. He even later writes in the report that \u201cthere are many other potential adverse events that can be induced by the novel RNA based vaccines against COVID-19\u201d and even goes so far as to state that \u201cthe vaccine could be a bioweapon and even more dangerous than the original infection\u201d.\nThe claims made in the report have been debunked by multiple fact-checkers, but before we go into that, it is important to note that the author of the report, J. Bart Classen, is known to be anti-vaccination. For one, he had written a letter to former US President Donald Trump in 2017 and called him stop government vaccine policies. In the letter, he wrote that \u201cvaccines cause chronic immune disorders such as autism, diabetes, asthma, allergies and multiple different autoimmune diseases [and] because of vaccines these diseases are increasing at epidemic proportions\u201d.\nNational File, the website that published the findings of Classen\u2019s report, is also identified by Media Bias Fact Check as \u201can extreme right Tin-Foil Hat Conspiracy website based on the promotion of unproven/debunked claims and a Strong Pseudoscience purveyor based on using junk science to support claims\u201d.\nClaim debunked by multiple fact-checks\nEven without much digging, we managed to find several different articles (USA TODAY, PolitiFact, American Council on Science and Health, The Dispatch Fact Check, Science-based Medicine) from US-based websites that debunk the claims made in Classen\u2019s report. Here\u2019s a summary of what each of them found.\nFirst of all, PolitiFact noted that there have been no instances of neurodegenerative or prion diseases documented in the US federal government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, despite millions of Americans having gotten vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Martha Sharan, a spokesperson for the CDC told PolitiFact that \u201cVAERS has received no reports of prion-related diseases, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) after COVID-19 vaccination [and there is] no evidence to date indicates a causative association between COVID-19 vaccines and these conditions\u201d.\nIn another fact-check, USA TODAY reported that it found no mention in its review of the U.S.\u00a0Food and Drug Administration\u2019s decision memorandums for both\u00a0Pfizer\u00a0and\u00a0Moderna\u2019s vaccines, which involved clinical trials with tens of thousands of volunteers. When USA TODAY checked in with Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with Georgetown University, she said that Classen\u2019s paper \u201cno scientific weight at all\u201d. She also noted that the journal his article is published in, Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, was \u201cnot a reputable or reliable journal\u201d.\nDr. Rasmussen was echoed by Jacob Yount, associate professor in the Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity at Ohio State University, who told The Dispatch Fact Check that the journal isn\u2019t listed on Pubmed, which is \u201cthe major U.S. index of scholarly biomedical publications\u201d. Yount even added that there are several indications that the journal in question could be a \u201cso-called predatory journal\u201d, which \u201cgenerally means that you can publish anything as long as you pay the publication charges\u201d.\nOn the claims made on the study, Yount said that it \u201cseems to be based on gibberish presented in a seemingly scientific manner\u201d and noted that \u201cmRNA vaccines have a longer history of testing in humans that started several years before the COVID vaccines, and these past vaccines were found to be safe and have not resulted in prion disease\u201d.\nVincent Racaniello, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University also told The Dispatch Fact Check in an email that \u201cthe study by Classen is a theoretical exercise in which he assesses if the mRNA vaccine can convert cell proteins to prion conformations\u201d. Said Racaniello: \u201cThe exercise is completely speculative and flawed and no conclusions can be drawn from this study. Hence the claims on social media are completely wrong as they are based on a flawed study from which no conclusions can be made.\u201d\nDr. David Gorski, professor of surgery and oncology at the Wayne State University School of Medicine, also wrote in Science-Based Medicine that Classen\u2019s report is a \u201cwhole heck of a lot of speculation, with the finding of an obscure connection based on methodology that is not explained with anywhere near the level of rigour that a real molecular biologist or bioinformatics scientist would require to be convinced\u201d.\nTherefore, with the lack of evidence that Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine causes prion or neurodegenerative diseases, Classen\u2019s questionable background and the fact that the claim has been debunked by reputable fact-checkers and medical experts, we rate the claim as false.\n\n",
