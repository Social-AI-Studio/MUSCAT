    "Paragraphs": "\n[Editorial update: 17 September, 5:50pm] We have updated the article with a statement from Singapore Airlines (SIA) regarding the scholarship. We have also updated the rating from likely false to false.\n\u2013\nWe came across a post on Facebook, which seems to have been taken down at the time of publication.\n\nThe author of the post shares what looks to be a screenshot from a website talking about the SIA Youth Scholarship \u2013 something that emerged as a point of contention earlier this month.\nThen, a post, which appeared on Facebook group Concerned Citizens Band Together for a better Singapore, shared a screenshot of what looks to be a page about a scholarship exclusively for Indian national students on the Ministry of Education (MOE)\u2019s website.\n\nThe author of the post concluded that there is \u201cnothing for locals\u201d.\nIn our fact-check on the claim that there was no scholarships for local students, we managed to locate the source of the screenshot\u00a0on MOE\u2019s website. It is important to note that the link is now broken, though MOE later clarified in an email to us that \u201cDue to COVID-19, some scholarship schemes have been suspended. MOE\u2019s website has therefore been updated accordingly.\u201d\nRegardless, we\u00a0managed to find a cached version of the page (last updated 30 December 2019) using\u00a0Wayback Machine:\n\nAs a brief summary of the information on the page, the SIA Youth Scholarship covers 2 years of Pre-University studies in selected Junior Colleges in Singapore and is renewed annually, subject to performance of the scholar. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any bond attached to it.\nBenefits of the scholarship include:\n\nAnnual allowance with hostel accommodation\nSettling-in allowance\nReturn economy class air passage\nCoverage of school fees.\nCoverage of GCE A Level examination fees (once only)\nSubsidised medical benefits and accident insurance cover\n\nGiven that the scholarship is for individuals who \u201cwish to enter Singapore schools at the Pre-University 1 Level in 2020\u201d, the application period was from 24 June to 28 July 2019, with selected scholars arriving in Singapore end January 2020. Applications for the scholarships are now closed.\nIt is not mentioned whether or not the \u2018SIA\u2019 stands for Singapore Airlines, but a check on\u00a0scholarships offered by Singapore Airlines\u00a0only seems to show scholarships for students looking to enter university. Successful applicants would also be required to sign a bond to serve Singapore Airlines for 6 years.\nIn an email responding to our query on what \u2018SIA\u2019 stands for, MOE mentioned that they \u201cprovide a wide range of scholarships and financial aid, predominantly to Singaporeans\u201d and that they \u201cpartner various organisations, including Singapore Airlines (SIA), to administer some of these scholarships\u201d.\nLet\u2019s now go back to the latest Facebook post we came across.\nWe managed to trace the screenshot to schools.chekrs.com, which appears to cover information about the SIA Youth Scholarship intake for 2020-21.\nDoing a side-by-side comparison of information on the SIA Youth Scholarship on MOE\u2019s website with Chekrs, we see that the only thing that seems to have been changed is the year of the application and selection process.\n\nIt is puzzling how Chekrs managed to get information of what is purportedly the SIA Youth Scholarship intake for 2020-21 when the latest information from MOE themselves was for 2019-2020.\nHowever, it is important to note that Chekrs themselves state that they are \u201cnot [an] official website\u201d and are \u201cnot associated with any Government organisation\u201d. In the disclaimer, they also reveal that the information they provide are \u201ccollected from various online and offline sources\u201d and are \u201cfor reference purpose only\u201d. It also advises members of the public to \u201cfollow the official website only\u201d.\nIn their previous correspondence with us, MOE shared that \u201cdue to COVID-19, some scholarship schemes have been suspended\u201d. Given that the webpage for the SIA Youth Scholarship is currently down, it appears that the scholarship (and application for it) is suspended.\nWe reached out to MOE and SIA for clarification on whether or not the information on Chekrs is accurate, and SIA has responded to our queries.\nSIA\u2019s clarification is as follows:\n\u201cSingapore Airlines (SIA) has partnered government agencies such as the Ministry of Education (MOE) to administer scholarships in the past. However, we no longer do so.\nSIA believes in investing in and grooming young talent to bring future leaders into the organisation. We are committed to seeking individuals who can contribute to our future growth and success, and offer a suite of scholarships to this end.\nThese include the SIA Open Overseas Scholarship, the SIA-Mendaki Scholarship, SIA-Sinda scholarship and Singapore Industry Scholarship programmes. For more information on our scholarship programmes, please visit:\u00a0https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/careers/students-internship/.\u201d\nTherefore, the claim that SIA is giving scholarships to \u201cIndian only trainee pilots\u201d in 2020 is false.\n\n",
