    "Tags": [],
    "Paragraphs": "\nOn 19 February 2018, the States Times Review / Singapore Herald claimed (on a Youtube description) that there was misrepresentation by the Minister.\n\nThis is fake news.\n\nMinister Heng had stated in his Budget Speech that in the term of the current government, there was an accumulated fiscal surplus \u2013 Accumulated over the term of the current government. There was no denial that for FY 2019, an overall budget deficit of S$3.5 billion was expected. Any comment made in CNA must be seen in this context.\nWe extract the relevant part of Minister\u2019s speech as follows:-\n\u201cFor FY2019, our budget position remains expansionary, with a basic deficit of $7.1 billion. Ministries\u2019 total expenditures are expected to be $80.3 billion, 1.6% higher than in FY2018. We are setting aside funds to meet Singaporeans\u2019 long-term needs, including $6.1 billion for the Merdeka Generation Package and $5.1 billion for long-term care support. On the whole, we expect an overall budget deficit of $3.5 billion, or 0.7% of GDP. (Refer to Annex F.)\nWe have sufficient fiscal surplus accumulated over this term of Government to fund the overall deficit in FY2019. There is no draw on past reserves.\u201d\n\u00a0\n",
