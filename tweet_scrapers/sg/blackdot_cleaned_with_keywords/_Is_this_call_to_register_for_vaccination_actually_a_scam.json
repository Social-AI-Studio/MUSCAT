    "Paragraphs": "\nWe\u2019ve been alerted to these messages being forwarded on WhatsApp:\n\nThe first message depicts what appears to be a screenshot of an SMS from the Ministry of Health (MOH). The SMS\u2019 content informs the recipient that they are eligible for \u2018Phase 1 vaccination\u2019 from 1 Jan 2021 and provides a link to which the recipient can register for an appointment.\nThe next message forwarded warns that the link provided in the screenshot is a phishing attempt, and that a \u2018dental colleague\u2019 who received it called MOH to check its legitimacy. It is not specified who this dental colleague is.\nFake \u2018fake news\u2019?\nWe found it rather strange that the domain of the URL in the screenshot is that of \u2018gov.sg\u2019, an indication that it could very well be a legitimate webpage created by the Singapore Government. To verify our guess, we typed in the URL in the SMS sans the code and we are directed to this webpage:\n\nAs seen in the screenshot, it is indeed a legitimate webpage under the gov.sg domain for individuals to register for the COVID-19 vaccine. The page also contains two input fields \u2013 one that asks for NRIC/FIN and another that asks for a 10-character registration code that was sent via SMS.\nWhen we entered the URL with the code, we were led to the same page, but with the code automatically filled out in the top input field:\n\nGiven that so far, evidence doesn\u2019t seem to point towards the link being the work of scammers, is this a case of a legitimate webpage being \u2018wrongly accused\u2019 of being a phishing scam?\nMOH\u2019s update\nOn 7 January, MOH put up a notice on its website to inform the public that SMSes the COVID-19 vaccination programme is being rolled out progressively, and that SMSes to invite those who are eligible to register for registration, starting with healthcare workers.\nMOH adds that those who receive the notification should not forward it to others as the invitation is unique to them, and should check that the link in the SMS ends with \u2018gov.sg\u2019 before clicking on it.\n\nThe screenshot in the SMS does fulfil the criteria as stated in the MOH notice in that it:\n\nEnds with \u2018gov.sg\u2019\nContains a unique invitation code\nAppears to be part of the progressive roll-out of the vaccination exercise\n\nTherefore, the claim that the link in the SMS is a phishing scam is likely false.\n\nWe have reached out to MOH for clarification, and will update the article when we get a reply.\n",
