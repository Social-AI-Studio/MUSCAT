    "Title": "Are robbers posing as \u2018Home Affairs Officers\u2019 looting homes in Singapore?  ",

    "Paragraphs": "\nWe came across this message being forwarded on WhatsApp:\n\nThe message claims that there is a group of individuals going from house-to-house pretending to be \u2018Home Affairs Officers\u2019. Apparently, these individuals \u201chave the documents and the letterhead of the department of the home ministry\u201d and are going around to check if the public possess a \u201cvalid identity card for the upcoming census\u201d. According to the message, these individuals are actually robbers who are looting houses.\nIt is not mentioned specifically which country this is taking place in, or when the \u201cupcoming census\u201d actually is.\n\u201cDepartment of the home ministry\u201d? \u201cUpcoming census\u201d?\nPutting aside the questionable English, it is important to note that in Singapore, there is no \u201cdepartment of the home ministry\u201d \u2013 only a Ministry of Home Affairs.\nIt is also important to note that the census is conducted every 10 years in Singapore. The most recent edition, \u2018The Census of Population 2020\u2033, which took into account broad trends and changes relating to the resident population in Singapore between 2010 and 2020, was published very recently in June 2021. Therefore, the claim that there is an \u201cupcoming census\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly check out.\nMore significantly, when we did a Google search of the terms \u201chome affairs officers looting\u201d, we came across several fact-checks published on websites from Singapore, India, Malaysia and the US on rather similar claims.\nWe read in an article published on The Straits Times in January 2018 which reports about a text message being circulated in Singapore and Malaysia that warns recipients to be wary of a group of people \u201cpretending to be officials from home affairs\u201d and \u201cclaim to be confirming that everyone has a valid ID for the upcoming elections\u201d but are actually \u201crobbing homes\u201d.\nInterestingly, the article noted that the claim is true \u2013 but that it was only applicable in South Africa, where the warning was issued by its Department of Home Affairs in October 2017.\n\nThe South African Department of Home Affairs had taken to Twitter once again in 2019 to warn the public about the same scam.\nBelow is a screenshot of the viral message on a fact-check by Times of India, published March 2019, which sounds very much like the viral message mentioned in The Straits Times\u2019 article.\n\nAs seen, the claim being made was that there were robbers pretending \u201cofficials from home affairs\u201d going from house-to-house to check for valid IDs \u201cfor the upcoming elections\u201d. Once again, the fact-check noted that the claims appear to be repurposed from the warning by the\u00a0South African Department of Home Affairs.\nLike a zombie that doesn\u2019t seem to die, this message reemerged again recently in Malaysia.\nIn a fact-check by The Star in Malaysia published July 2021, we see that the Immigration Department in Malaysia had even debunked the claims via a Facebook post, saying that this was \u201cdone by irresponsible parties\u201d and that \u201cthe public is advised not to spread such fake news which would cause public outrage\u201d.\n\nIt is in this article by US-based factcheck.org published in December 2019 that we see claims of robbers in disguise checking for valid IDs for an \u201cupcoming census\u201d being circulated by US Facebook users. Below is the image that was being circulated:\n\nThe US Census Bureau had debunked the claims, saying: \u201cThis is a hoax that originated overseas.\u201d\nIt added that while \u201ccensus employees are in neighbourhoods across the country as they prepare for next year\u2019s census\u201d, \u201cemployees are not asking the public for any identification\u201d.\nTherefore, based off previous fact-checks, the lack of a \u201cdepartment of the home ministry\u201d in Singapore and the fact that there doesn\u2019t seem to be an \u2018upcoming census\u2019, we rate the claim that there are robbers posing as \u2018Home Affairs Officers\u2019 looting homes in Singapore as false.\n\n",
