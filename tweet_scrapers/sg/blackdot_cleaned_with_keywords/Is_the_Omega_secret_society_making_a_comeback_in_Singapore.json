    "Paragraphs": "\n\nTowards the evening of Friday 23 August 2019, we came across posts on Reddit, Instagram and messages on Whatsapp claiming that the Omega secret society was making a comeback, and that they were gathering in groups around the Tampines and Yishun areas.\u00a0 In addition to seeking to recruit members, if refused, these groups would beat up men who refused them.\u00a0 They could possibly also rape women.\nApparently there are also other messages saying that another gang known as the \u201csalakau\u201d gang is also making a comeback (see here).\nPlease note that these messages are\u00a0false.\u00a0 There has been\u00a0no evidence of any such comeback by the Omega Gang.\nThe Omega Gang is a famous secret society in Singapore which came into existence sometime in 1989.\u00a0 It is made up exclusively of male Malay-muslims.\nThe \u2018Salakau\u2019 gang is another famous secret society in Singapore that had a history dating back even earlier than the Omega gang.\u00a0 Its name is a mandarin dialect pronunciation of the numbers \u201c3\u201d, \u201c6\u201d and \u201c9\u201d.\u00a0 The gang is made up predominantly of Chinese members but did not restrict membership exclusively to Chinese.\nThere is no evidence of any comeback by either gang and the Singapore Police Force has issued a press release on Saturday (24 August 2019) to clarify that there is no such gang activity taking place (either the Omega or Salakau gangs).\nThe messages that we have seen are set out below, and our analysis further down after the messages:\n\nWhy we agree that the messages are fake\nFirst, the Singapore Police Force has issued a press release clarifying that their investigation has shown that the content of the messages is false.\n\nIn addition to the Police\u2019s message, we noticed that so far, some social media accounts claim to have video evidence of the recruitment taking place by these gangs.\u00a0 However, such evidence has been debunked.\nSee an example of such alleged video evidence here.\nShortly after the video was posted, others in the online community countered to say that the video was misleading and that it actually only showed a group of people engaging in Dikir Barat, which is a musical form native to the Malay Peninsula, involving singing in groups.\n\nto whoever seen this video. pls dont jump to conclusions\u2026 its just us #MakyongKedekFamily a dikir barat group who just finished our training for the upcoming competition. https://t.co/W67nAcjkSB\n\u2014 AMIRUL ASHRAF IYUN (@AmirulAshrafIyu) August 23, 2019\n\nSee also, an Observer+ video on the matter here.\u00a0 In other words, there is\u00a0no evidence\u00a0whatsoever about any gang activity taking place.\nWe also observe that in Singapore, the Secret Societies Branch of the Singapore Police Force has a fearsome reputation, backed by the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (the \u201cCLPTA\u201c)\u00a0(which has been \u2018temporary\u2019 for over 4 decades to date).\nThe CLTPA allows for the detention of suspected criminals without trial for the sake of \u201cpublic safety, peace and good order\u201d. In 2017, the total detainee population in Singapore\u2019s prisons under the CLPTA was 103.\u00a0 The vast majority, being 86 of them, were jailed for secret society activities. These have been the majority since 2015.\u00a0 As a former gang member has said in a CNA interview in April, 2018:\n\u201cMost gang members fear detention (without trial) \u2013 they all know they\u2019ll be in prison for an unknown period.\u201d\nRead more here.\nAccordingly, there is plenty of reason to doubt that the gangs would engage in such activities which would have drawn such unwanted attention to themselves.\u00a0\u00a0Given the above, it is plain that we should regard the allegations made regarding the Omega gang as false.\u00a0 Police investigations on the perpetrator(s) of the messages are ongoing, and we expect to be able to update with more information shortly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",
