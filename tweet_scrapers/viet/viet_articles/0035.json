        "Claim: On Sept. 3, The Atlantic published an article claiming that President Trump called members of the American military that have died, or captured, in wars, \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers.\u201d",
        "\nRating: This claim is MOSTLY TRUE. Although Trump has denied making those statements, a number of other news outlets, including Fox News, have confirmed The Atlantic\u2019s reporting. In addition, there is a video of Trump calling the late Senator John McCain a \u201closer\u201d for being captured during the Vietnam War. \n",
        "",
        "In an article dated Sept. 3, The Atlantic reported that in 2018, President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris, dedicated to American soldiers who died during World War I. Trump reportedly said, \u201cWhy should I go to that cemetery? It\u2019s filled with losers.\u201d Trump also referred to the more than 1,800 Marines who lost their lives at the Belleau Wood Battle as \u201csuckers\u201d for getting killed. The quotes were provided by anonymous sources with firsthand knowledge of the events.",
        "According to another source, on Memorial Day 2017, Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery with then-secretary of homeland security, John Kelly, who later became Trump\u2019s chief of staff for a short period. Kelly\u2019s son Robert was killed in 2010 in Afghanistan and is buried at the cemetery. While there, Trump allegedly said, \u201cI don\u2019t get it. What was in it for them?\u201d referring to the military personnel buried at the cemetery. Kelly declined to comment for The Atlantic.",
        "Trump responded to the article in a tweet, saying, \u201cThis is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election!\u201d",
        "Despite Trump\u2019s denial, AP and CNN have confirmed The Atlantic\u2019s reporting. In addition, Fox News military correspondent Jennifer Griffin tweeted: \u201cAccording to one former senior Trump administration official: \u2018When the President spoke about the Vietnam War, he said, \u2018It was a stupid war. Anyone who went was a sucker\u2019.\u2019\u201d\u00a0",
        "Griffin also added that according to her sources, \u201cThe President just hated John McCain. He always asked, \u2018Why do you see him as a hero?\u2019\u201d She added that \u201cTwo sources confirmed the President did not want flags lowered [when McCain died] but others in the White House ordered them at half mast.\u201d According to The Atlantic, Trump said, \u201cWhat the fuck are we doing that for? Guy was a fucking loser.\u201d",
        "These comments about McCain are aligned with Trump\u2019s previous comments about the late senator. In 2015, Trump said at a live event, \u201cHe lost, so I never liked him as much after that, \u2019cause I don\u2019t like losers.\u201d He then added. \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured.\u201d McCain was captured by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, and was imprisoned for five and a half years. Because of Trump\u2019s words, McCain\u2019s wife Cindy, has endorsed Joe Biden for president.",
        "\n\n",
        "Conclusion: Trump has denied making these statements about the military. But based on The Atlantic\u2019s reporting\u2014and the subsequent confirmation with various news outlets\u2014we believe that these allegations against him are credible.",
