        "Claim: President Trump recently said on Twitter that he has been more successful than the late Senator John McCain in creating beneficial policies for military veterans.",
        "\nRating: This claim is MOSTLY FALSE. Trump regularly takes credit for laws and practices that were codified during the Obama administration. In addition, Trump\u2019s policies have not been beneficial to the military. To this day, Trump has not criticized Russia for placing a bounty on American troops.\u00a0\n",
        "On Sept 3 on Twitter, in response to The Atlantic article that claimed he called military service members \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d including the late Senator John McCain, President Trump tweeted, \u201cI disagreed with [McCain] with respect to the vets and the taking care of the VA [hospital system]. I wanted to do it a much different way, and I think it\u2019s proven to be a much more successful way when you look at the success we\u2019ve had with the VA and with our vets.\u201d",
        "Trump then took credit for the Veterans Choice health care program, which was actually sponsored by McCain and signed into law by President Obama in 2014. McCain served during the Vietnam War and was a prisoner of war for 5-and-a-half years. The law McCain sponsored allowed veterans to be covered by the government for receiving care from private doctors outside the VA health system. Trump did sign the VA MISSION Act in 2018 that expanded Veterans Choice.\u00a0",
        "Trump frequently points to VA accomplishments such as improved wait times and the offering of same-day mental health services. But those improvements began under the Obama administration.",
        "From a policy perspective, Trump\u2019s policies have not been beneficial to the military. To this day, Trump has not offered a repudiation of Russia placing a bounty on American troops. He has called those reports a \u201choax,\u201d even though it has been confirmed by the CIA. Senator Tammy Duckworth, who is an Iraq War veteran and Purple Heart recipient, has condemned Trump\u2019s inaction. Meanwhile, Trump has questioned Duckworth\u2019s patriotism.",
        "Furthermore, postmaster general Louis DeJoy, appointed by Trump, has been approving policies which have caused delays in service from the United States Postal Service. Those mail delays have also caused delays in medications for veterans. More than 90% of veterans depend on the USPS for their medication.",
        "According to a poll conducted by The Military Times, a plurality of active-service members (49.9%) held an unfavorable view of Trump; 37.8% had a favorable view. The poll also showed a preference for Joe Biden among active-service members. Biden\u2019s late son, Beau, served in Iraq. ",
        "Cindy McCain, John McCain\u2019s widow, has endorsed Biden for president. As of Sept. 24, 2020,\u00a0two former military\u00a0leaders have stepped forward to endorse Biden. They are the former leader of the Coast Guard, Admiral\u00a0Paul Zukunft, and the former vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Air Force General\u00a0Paul Selva.",
        "Conclusion: Trump\u2019s remarks about how beneficial his administration has been for veterans and the military are MOSTLY FALSE. As a result of his actions, a majority of active-service members have an unfavorable view of Trump.",
