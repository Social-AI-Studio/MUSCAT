        "When I was growing up, one of my favorite T\u1ebft traditions was when we would gather in the backyard and burn fake money so we could \u201c\u0110\u01b0a \u00d4ng T\u00e1o v\u1ec1 tr\u1eddi\u201d (\u201cSend the Kitchen God home to heaven\u201d). It was always funny to me that even spirits needed cash in order to fly home (gods, they\u2019re just like us!). I was thinking of \u00d4ng T\u00e1o lately as I\u2019m sitting in my New York apartment, across the country from my parents. This year, many of us are unable to go home and gather with our loved ones, making this T\u1ebft more melancholy than years past. But as we leave the Year of the Rat behind (good riddance), I am grateful for the community that we\u2019ve built here at VietFactCheck: A community of people passionate about truth and dialogue, and willing to have tough conversations even when it hurts. So for this year, I wish you all good health and fast vaccinations, enough money to weather any instability, and peace both in your life and in your mind. I can\u2019t send you any l\u00ec x\u00ec, but I will be thinking of all of you as I\u2019m sending my own NYC kitchen god home. Ch\u00fac m\u1eebng n\u0103m m\u1edbi!",
