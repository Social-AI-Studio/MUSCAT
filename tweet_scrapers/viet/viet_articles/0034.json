        "Claim: In early September, journalist Bob Woodward disclosed that Trump told him that he intentionally downplayed COVID-19 to the public.\u00a0",
        "\nRating: This claim is TRUE. CNN released recordings of private conversations between Trump and Woodward, in which Trump explicitly said he wanted to downplay the coronavirus. Trump has since acknowledged making the statements.\n",
        "",
        "\n\n",
        "From Dec. 2019 to Jul. 2020, Trump participated in 18 wide-ranging interviews with Woodward, a famed journalist, about his book on the president called \u201cRage.\u201d Woodward recorded the interviews with Trump\u2019s permission, and CNN obtained and released copies of some of the audio ahead of the book\u2019s release.",
        "The recordings show that Trump told Woodward in early February that he knew how deadly the virus was. In another recording in March, he admitted he kept that knowledge hidden from the public. \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Trump told Woodward on March 19, \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201c",
        "The recordings also revealed other things that Trump told Woodward about the pandemic that hugely differed from what he said publicly.\u00a0",
        "Comparing COVID-19 to the flu: On Feb. 7, Trump acknowledged to Woodward that coronavirus is more deadly than the flu. \u201cIt\u2019s also more deadly than your\u2026strenuous flus\u2026This is more deadly,\u201d Trump said on the recordings. But a few weeks later, Trump falsely claimed in a Feb. 26 press briefing that mortality rates are higher for the flu than coronavirus.",
        "Who can get COVID-19: On Mar. 19, Trump told Woodward, \u201cNow it\u2019s turning out it\u2019s not just old people, Bob. Just today and yesterday, some startling facts came out. It\u2019s not just old\u2026It\u2019s plenty of young people.\u201d Despite this alleged realization, in public Trump repeatedly asserted that it was predominantly the elderly who had to worry. On May 5, he claimed \u201cchildren aren\u2019t affected\u201d by the virus.\u00a0",
        "After these recordings were made public, Trump admitted during a white House briefing on Sep. 9 that he made those statements. \u201cThe fact is I\u2019m a cheerleader for this country. I love our country. And I don\u2019t want people to be frightened. I don\u2019t want to create panic, as you say, and certainly I\u2019m not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want to show confidence. We want to show strength.\u201d",
        "Conclusion: Based on the recordings that have been released of Trump and his acknowledgement that those recordings were accurate, we believe that he did intentionally downplay the danger of COVID-19 to the American public. To find out how many times Trump downplayed the virus, read this article.",
