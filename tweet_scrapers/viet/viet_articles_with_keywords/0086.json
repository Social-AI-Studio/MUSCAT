        "On August 3, 2020, HBO aired an interview with President Trump on the program \u201cAxios on HBO\u201d during which reporter Jonathan Swan questioned Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. During this interview, Trump repeated several misleading claims about the government\u2019s handling of COVID-19. Most notably, he presented charts about the US death rate from COVID-19 and stated, \u201cRight here, the United States is lowest in numerous categories, we\u2019re lower than the world, we\u2019re lower than Europe.\u201d",
        "The way in which Trump calculated the death rate was misleading. When confronted by Swan, it turns out that Trump used a lower U.S. death rate by calculating the number of deaths in comparison to confirmed cases, which depends on the number of tests done. A more appropriate measure of the impact of the disease would be to calculate the death rate compared to the country\u2019s overall population, which is how the Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines the mortality (death) rate.",
        "According to statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University, the US ranks the fourth highest for mortality rate as defined by proportion of the US population, among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19.\u00a0",
        "",
        "(as of August 30th)",
        "In the interview, both men specifically called out South Korea\u2019s numbers compared to the US. At the time of the interview on Aug. 4, South Korea reported 300 deaths compared to its 51 million population (0.000588235%), while the US reported 156,753 deaths to 331 million population (0.047357401%). In other words, the US has a death rate that is 80 times worse than South Korea:",
        "",
        "Conclusion: Trump misrepresented the US\u2019s mortality rate from COVID-19 during his Axios interview. His struggling performance in the interview also highlighted Trump\u2019s inability to comprehend the severity of the global pandemic and basic concepts like mortality rate.
