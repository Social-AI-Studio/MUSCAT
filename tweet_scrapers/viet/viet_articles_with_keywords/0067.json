        "Claim: Many Vietnamese Americans believe that Biden supports China and that his presidency will inevitably lead to China\u2019s domination over Vietnam.",
        "Rating: This claim is MOSTLY FALSE. While Biden previously supported China\u2019s economic progress, he has become critical of its political repression and recent aggression in disputed territories. Rather, experts believe that Biden\u2019s presidency will follow a hardline approach with China that is similar to Trump.",
        "",
        "Biden has a complex history with China, but experts say that Biden\u2019s administration will have a hard-line approach with China. His complex history includes being part of the first U.S. delegation as a young senator to visit Beijing following diplomatic normalization in 1979. He also favored supporting normalizing trade relations with China and its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. These acts stem from Biden\u2019s preference for a rules-based system of international order. But these acts, from decades ago, have led some to mistakenly believe that Biden is \u201cpro-China\u201d and \u201cpro-communism.\u201d\u00a0",
        "Furthermore, Biden\u2019s position on China has undergone \u201ca tectonic shift.\u201d His more recent statements and actions reflect and reinforce the rising anti-China consensus in the US. His shifting views are representative of a broader transformation in how the Washington establishment sees China.\u00a0",
        "Here are three examples of Biden\u2019s hardline approach to China:",
        "\nWhen Biden was vice president in 2014, he confronted a top Chinese general when China deployed an oil rig in a part of the South China Sea that Vietnam claimed was within its territory. He told China\u2019s military\u2019s chief of staff to stop \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cprovocative\u201d acts and that China cannot undermine security and peace. China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea led to anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam and abroad.\nRecently, Biden strongly condemned China\u2019s handling of Hong Kong protests. In July 2020, he called Beijing\u2019s new national security law \u201ca death blow to the freedoms and autonomy that set Hong Kong apart from the rest of China.\u201d If elected US president, he said he would impose swift economic sanctions if China tried to silence US citizens and companies for exercising first amendment rights. He also said he would \u201cprohibit U.S. companies from abetting repression and supporting the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s surveillance state.\u201d\nDuring the democratic primary earlier this year, Biden called China\u2019s President Xi Jinping a \u201cthug\u201d for his prosecution of Uihghurs, China\u2019s Muslim minority. When describing Xi, he said, \u201cThis is a guy who doesn\u2019t have a democratic-with-a-small-\u2018d\u2019 bone in his body.\u201d\n",
        "Much of Biden\u2019s anti-China rhetoric resembles that of the Trump administration. But in contrast, Biden\u2019s strategy against China appears to be through rebuilding powerful alliances, making investments in international organizations, and establishing multilateral crisis resolutions to counter China. A notable example of this occurred during the Obama presidency, when Biden advocated for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement that would have united a dozen countries, including Vietnam and not China, and would have kept China\u2019s regional expansion in check. The TPP was considered the largest and most comprehensive trade agreement ever created. But in January 2017, Trump revoked the TPP on his third day in office. A top China expert called Trump\u2019s decision to exit the TPP the \u201cbiggest strategic mistake the United States has ever made\u201d against China.",
        "Conclusion: We found the claim that Biden is pro-China to be MOSTLY FALSE because it does not reflect Biden\u2019s current hardline approach against China.\u00a0",
