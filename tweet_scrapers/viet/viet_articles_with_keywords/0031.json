        "Claim: Unauthorized ballot drop boxes\u2014some marked as \u201cofficial\u201d\u2014have been appearing in Los Angeles, Orange, and Fresno counties in California. It was reported that the California Republican Party was behind these illegal ballot boxes.",
        "\nRating: This is TRUE. The California Republican Party admitted responsibility for placing more than 50 deceptively labeled \u201cofficial\u201d drop boxes for mail-in ballots in these counties\u2014an action that state officials have called illegal and could lead to election fraud. State officials have ordered the boxes be removed, but GOP leaders have not complied. State officials and prosecutors are currently investigating.\n",
        "",
        "On the weekend of October 10, election officials received reports of unauthorized ballot boxes in battleground congressional districts in Fresno, Los Angeles, and Orange counties. While the boxes did not look like the official ballot boxes issued by the counties, they could be mistaken for one since they were deceptively marked as \u201cofficial ballot drop boxes,\u201d \u201cballot drop boxes,\u201d or \u201csecure.\u201d They were found in front of churches, political party headquarters, and gun shops. Known sites of some of the unauthorized boxes were reportedly not found on any official county voting websites.\u00a0",
        "Jordan Tygh, a regional field director for the California GOP, posted on Oct. 8, 2020 a picture of himself wearing a Michelle Steel for Congress mask and in front of an unauthorized drop-boxes on Twitter, along with a message encouraging voters to contact him for drop-box locations.\u00a0The post\u00a0has since been deleted.",
        "",
        "The California secretary of state issued a memo stating the unauthorized ballot drop boxes were illegal and was a felony punishable of up to four years in prison. \u201cIn short, providing unauthorized, non-official vote-by-mail ballot drop boxes is prohibited by state law,\u201d the memo said.\u00a0",
        "State regulations say that only county officials have the authority to designate the location, hours of operation, and number of drop boxes in a county.\u00a0",
        "California\u2019s Republican Party acknowledged that they placed the ballot drop boxes. The state GOP spokesman Hector Barajas said the boxes are allowed under the state\u2019s \u201cballot harvesting\u201d law. Under California law, it is legal for voters to hand their absentee or mail-in ballots to a third party, who will then drop them into a mailbox or polling place.",
        "Barajas declined to say how many boxes exist and where they are located. But an operative with direct knowledge of the effort said that Republican officials purchased about 100 of the boxes to boost turnout, especially in competitive down-ballot races. They installed about half of them by the time state officials noticed.",
        "California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that the ballot boxes are illegal and issued a cease and desist order demanding that GOP officials remove the boxes by Oct. 15. They said that in order to safely drop off their ballot to a third party, the voter has to know who that person is they\u2019re giving the ballot to, and both parties have to sign the ballot envelope to establish a paper trail. The Republican-installed ballot boxes are not secure and can easily be tampered with. In addition, marking an unofficial ballot box as \u201cofficial\u201d can be seen as impersonating an elections officer, which is a felony.",
        "So far, the state Republican Party has not complied with the order. State officials and local prosecutors are currently investigating the matter further.",
