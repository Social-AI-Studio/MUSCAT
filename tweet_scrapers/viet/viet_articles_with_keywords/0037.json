        "Claim: Many Vietnamese Americans believe that Trump is pro-military and anti-communist. Some even believed he was supportive of the Vietnam War against communism.",
        "\nRating: This claim is FALSE. Trump has repeatedly made statements disapproving or insulting the US\u2019s role in the Vietnam War.\n",
        "",
        "This claim is false based on Trump\u2019s statements about the Vietnam War. From 1993 to 2019, Trump has spoken on the record about the Vietnam War at least six times. These statements ranged from mocking US efforts in the Vietnam War to insulting veterans who actually served in the War and even going so far as calling a prisoner of war \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d\u00a0",
        "On US efforts in the Vietnam War, Trump said:",
        "2019: \u201cI was never a fan of that war\u2026I thought it was a terrible war, it was very far away\u2026nobody had ever heard of the country.\u201d",
        "2016: \u201cI was never a fan of the Vietnam War\u2026But I was never at the protest level, either, because I had other things to do.\u201d",
        "When talking about dating and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), Trump has compared it to the Vietnam War multiple times:",
        "2004: \u201cI tell my sons just to get a nice girlfriend and be happy, because it\u2019s dangerous out there (referring to STDs)\u2026It\u2019s Vietnam.\u201d",
        "1997: When asked how he handled making sure he wasn\u2019t contracting STDs from the women he was sleeping with, Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I can\u2019t even believe it. I\u2019ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world, it is a dangerous world out there. It\u2019s like Vietnam, sort of. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.\u201d",
        "1993: \u201cYou know, if you\u2019re young, and in this era, and if you have any guilt about not having gone to Vietnam, we have our own Vietnam \u2014 it\u2019s called the dating game\u2026Dating is like being in Vietnam. You\u2019re the equivalent of a soldier going over to Vietnam.\u201d",
        "Regarding Vietnam War veteran and prisoner of war Sen. John McCain (R), who spent more than five years in a North Vietnamese prison, Trump said:",
        "2015: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero\u2026I like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d",
        "It is estimated that over 2,500 American service members were captured by North Vietnam. Additionally, around 200,000 South Vietnamese military personnel and civilians were believed to be captured and imprisoned in North Vietnamese re-education camps.",
        "Conclusion: Trump\u2019s words show that he did not support US efforts in the Vietnam War. Trump has a long history of saying he disapproved of the Vietnam War and insulting the bravery and struggle of those who actually served in the same war. In addition, Trump avoided serving for over a decade through deferments.",
