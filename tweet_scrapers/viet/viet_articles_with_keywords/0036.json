        "Claim: Several news outlets reported that Trump has repeatedly made public statements that COVID-19 was going to go away or disappear as the number of infected cases and deaths in the US increased.",
        "\nRating: This claim is TRUE. We reviewed a handful of news reports and confirmed that Trump told the public more than 30 times that COVID-19 was going away.\n",
        "",
        "",
        "",
        "Several news agencies collected and reported the number of times Trump downplayed the pandemic, especially after the release of private recordings of Trump admitting that he intentionally downplayed the effects of COVID-19 to the public. We wanted to examine if their reporting was accurate.",
        "We reviewed reporting from four different news agencies. We confirmed their reporting as accurate by reviewing and verifying their sources. We reviewed reports from The Washington Post (33 instances of downplaying), Rolling Stone (22 instances of downplaying), The Guardian (7 instances of downplaying), and Newsweek. All four reports detailed how Trump downplayed the virus as the total number of COVID-19 cases in the US and deaths have increased, which we also verified as true through data provided through The New York Times and The Atlantic\u2019s Covid Tracking Project.",
        "Here is a timeline of eight notable moments, originally identified by The Guardian and Newsweek, where Trump downplayed the virus:",
        "\nJan. 20: Just two days after the US identified its first coronavirus case, Trump told CNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d\nFeb. 26: By the time the US recorded 60 cases of infection, Trump said during a White House press briefing: \u201cWhen you have 15 people \u2026 within a couple of days it\u2019s going to be down to close to zero. That\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d On the following day, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day \u2013 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2013 it will disappear.\u201d\nMar. 10: When the US had 37 deaths and over 1,000 confirmed cases, Trump said during a press briefing: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\u201d\nApr. 29: When the US had its millionth positive test for coronavirus and was at over\u00a0 57,000 deaths \u2013 claiming more American lives than the Vietnam War \u2013 Trump told reporters: \u201cThis is going away. It\u2019s gonna go. It\u2019s gonna leave. It\u2019s gonna be gone. It\u2019s going to be eradicated \u2026 If you have a flare-up in a certain area \u2013 I call them burning embers \u2013 boom, you put it out.\u201d\nMay 11: In a coronavirus briefing, Trump announced, \u201cWe have met the moment, and we have prevailed. Americans do whatever it takes to find solutions, pioneer breakthroughs, and harness the energies we need to achieve a total victory.\u201d\nJun. 17: Trump continued to say the disease would disappear as America reached two million COVID-19 cases and over 113,000 deaths. In a radio call to Fox News, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s fading away. It\u2019s going to fade away. But having a vaccine would be really nice.\u201d\nJul. 19: Fox News Sunday played back to Trump his many claims that the virus would disappear. Trump shot back: \u201cI\u2019ll be right eventually. It\u2019s going to disappear, and I\u2019ll be right.\u201d The show\u2019s host, Chris Wallace, asked Trump whether his insistence that the virus would vanish, even while it proliferated, would discredit him. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, you know why?\u201d he replied. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been right probably more than anybody else.\u201d\nAug. 13: Trump insisted the coronavirus was \u201cgoing away\u201d in an interview, one day after the country reported its single-day record for COVID-19-related deaths since May. In an interview with Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re still in the pandemic, which will be going away, as I say. It\u2019ll be going away and they scream, \u2018How can you say that?'\u201d Trump told Bartiromo, referring to his political opponents. \u201cI said, \u2018Because it\u2019s going to be going away.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n",
        "Conclusion: The news reports that Trump downplayed the virus by telling the public that COVID-19 was going away are TRUE. As of Sept. 11, America has around 6.4 million cases of COVID-19 and 192,517 deaths, which stand in stark contrast to Trump\u2019s repeated promise that the disease would disappear under his leadership.",
