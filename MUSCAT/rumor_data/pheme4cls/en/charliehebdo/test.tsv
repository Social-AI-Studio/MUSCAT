Or is it a plant?|||||@jayanthkumarak @BBCBreaking exactly. This appeared to be a well-planned attack. It's like the supposed 9/11 hijacker's passport being found|||||@Noopolitik even if it was a plant we have the accomplice to corroborate. Let's not humor any conclusions either way.|||||@jayanthkumarak well, I can smell the bullshit from here...|||||@Noopolitik so are you a truther? Jeez. You people are full of it.|||||@jayanthkumarak and you seem a little confused brother.|||||@Noopolitik maybe I am, but let's not fuel the fire that all of this is orchestrated to exploit Muslims.|||||@jayanthkumarak I'm not saying that. I'm just saying this photo ID being found seems not to fit with the proposed scenario- or even logic.|||||@Noopolitik @jayanthkumarak @BBCBreaking can anyone say "false flag"? Who stands to gain from these murders?|||||@mhoust42 @jayanthkumarak @BBCBreaking https://t.co/sQnGh83bFv this is very strange if the video is genuine.|||||@Noopolitik @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking Unless you and I are ballistics and weapons specialists, we can't really infer seriously from this.|||||@jayanthkumarak @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking nope- and the video may have been tampered with. But IF this is genuine the shot missed. No blood.|||||@Noopolitik @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking But the body is in the mortuary there, for people to verify from, i'm sure. Let's be practical.|||||@jayanthkumarak @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking Maybe. We don't know what happened.

It isn't.|||||@jayanthkumarak @mhoust42 @BBCBreaking EXACTLY. Some people would like us to think it is. Hence incidents like this. I wonder why..? ;)|||||@Noopolitik  You're being willfully ignorant of the geopolitical situation in large parts of South Asia and Mid-East. You're wiser than that|||||@jayanthkumarak  There are real bad guys. But on the whole people want to get along in peace. That doesn't suit some people's agenda...|||||@Noopolitik While you'd like to think so, i invite you to visit India, and Pakistan. Lots of people on either side don't want to get along.|||||@jayanthkumarak I lived in the Middle East and elsewhere. Powerful vested interests manipulate geopolitics-  most people want peace.|||||@Noopolitik The Mid-East is a geopolitical quagmire. We can have several long discussions on all this.

He picked the runner of the road!|||||@Hashmat_M The runner was lost as it was too large.|||||@BBCBreaking Really? He left his ID? Do you not find that a bit strange? Maybe a finger print or something but his actual ID?|||||.@BBCBreaking that ID card could easily have been planted by the murderers. Hope no one innocent gets hurt.|||||@BBCBreaking highly suspicious about that personally|||||@BBCBreaking @arthurbarbato Ha! what an idiot.|||||@BBCBreaking US,European MSM present this news event as one of "troubled,deranged,angry individuals" not as an act of Islamic Terrorism.|||||@BBCBreaking @tonyblackburn like he is that stupid to leave it there..what bullshit!! shame on you blackburn for helping the NEW WORLD ORDER|||||@TroopsBackHome Not the faintest idea what you are going on about,anyhow have a great evening.|||||@tonyblackburn I was on about the New World Order.

People are murdered and beaten every day that doesn't make headline news.|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 and the only thing evolving is our means to carry out those same attacks.|||||@liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 should we ignore the poor innocents in syria just so we don't harm any of the ISIS 'volunteers' ?|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 no.  I supported action in Syria as it happens|||||@liberal_leftie @Pablo_1791 most wars are started by a maniac who uses religion as their motive .|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 absolutely. The problem we have though is others attacking all Muslims or Catholics or Jews because of a minority|||||@ljnicholls74 @Pablo_1791 would be like me attacking all tv presenters because of the actions of Jimmy Saville|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Your analogy would be apt if this were one attack by one person and not a long, wide pattern of jihad.|||||@Pablo_1791 @ljnicholls74 jimmy Saville wasn't alone in his actions either, so my analogy is sound.|||||@liberal_leftie @ljnicholls74 Ridiculous.

Oh, btw: "We have avenged the prophet!" https://t.co/avkL632xIs|||||@ljnicholls74 @liberal_leftie in the US this is carried every couple of month !! But they are catholics and so they're sick and nt terrorist|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan no we see worse ... Remember the Norwegian catholics who killed about 100 in a youths camp ? He was labelled 1/2|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan he was a lunatic. isis is a group that target vulnerable people because they can't fight back|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan as a psychopath... But if they are even muslims who might have dont it, they are extremist and terrorist !!|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan don't misunderstand me.NOT all muslims are terrorists. but at the moment all terrorists seem to be muslims|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan thats bcz the media labels any attack carried out by muslims as a terrorist attack !! But any attacker who isnt|||||@mostafaihab96 @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan Have you ever heard of Timothy McVeigh? He was called a domestic terrorist!|||||@acb4values @ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan seriously ?? U r gonna jump on a single exception ??|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Olympic park bombing, weather underground, Sikh Temple shooting, etc., were all listed as terrorist acts!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan by whom ?? The government or the media and the people|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Some media, but all by the government. With this President many Muslim shootings haven't been called terrorism!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan i dont care about the govt !! The federal govt acknowledged that only 6% of attacks were carried out by muslims|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan That's because they haven't labeled all attacks by Muslims as terrorist acts!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan but the majority !! Even you have to admit that the media is biased about this !!|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan 2 Muslim attacks on military bases were called work place violence!! That's STUPID!!|||||@acb4values what do they call christian attacks on schools ?? Just like the one carried out by taliban ??|||||@mostafaihab96 What Christian attacks on schools? Where? Were they yelling Jesus is Great while they were doing it?|||||@acb4values i ddnt see the boston bomber yelling any religious words !!|||||@mostafaihab96 That's funny!! They were cowards that put bombs by children and walked away quietly!!|||||@acb4values just like the coward person who shot and killed kids in cold-blood at schools|||||@mostafaihab96 So after making an accusation you should back up with evidence of Christian attacks on schools!!|||||@acb4values not only at schools !! There are loads of examples !! The IRA the Norwegian attacker who killed 86 in a youth camp|||||@acb4values but u r from the US and the school shootings are the most things i thought you would relate to|||||@acb4values but it was never my intention to make accusations. I am merely demonstrating that psychos who kills people are everywhere|||||@acb4values and not only muslims|||||@acb4values look ... Killers and psychos and from everywhere and every culture and every religion !!|||||@mostafaihab96 This is true, but there are millions of Muslims that condone this and rejoice at the killings!!|||||@acb4values not millions !! These are only a few who were fed lies there entire lives !!|||||@acb4values it happened before with christians with religious white groups who killed black people and celebrated it !!|||||@acb4values but now these groups have almost vanished and i believe this will happen to the few extremists !! And they r few compared|||||@acb4values to all the muslims in the world who believe in the religion of peace just like me !! Or do you think i am a terrorist ??|||||@acb4values but one thing we can agree on is that the western media is biased against muslims !! And consequently so are western people!!|||||@mostafaihab96 Actually, I would NEVER agree with that! They rarely even mention that it was a muslim attack, especially regarding Israel!|||||@acb4values i am just happy we agree on the same concepts !! Perhaps i am too pessimistic!! But when it comes to muslims i have seen it all|||||@acb4values some are really rational just like yourself whom i enjoy talking to learning how people look at us (muslims) trying to improve!|||||@mostafaihab96 I appreciate that, but you do need to know that acting at all like this was justified doesn't help. You seem reasonable too!|||||@acb4values its not justified and can never be explained and i am sorry if i gave you this impression !! Perhaps it was a misinterpretation|||||@mostafaihab96 I do know that there are peaceful Muslims, but not sure if Islam is a religion of peace. None of history shows that to be.|||||@mostafaihab96 We could have more world peace if we sought to understand each other better.|||||@acb4values but unfortunately there are also a few who would just insult me and would want to kill me !! Either way my response is the same|||||@mostafaihab96 Most of MSM placates to Muslim extremist! Even this they're calling Islamaphobia, when phobia is irrational fear!|||||@mostafaihab96 IT'S NOT irrational fear when they actually kill you for satire and being an "infidel"!|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan the point of difference was that if a muslim commits a crime most probably will be considered as a terrorist|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan however if a person committing the same crime is NOT muslim most probably will be considered sick psycho|||||@acb4values @piersmorgan and i think this only started after 9-11 ... Not after mcveigh !! And that the media is to blame !!|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan After we saw the thousands of Muslims rejoicing in the streets at the murders!!|||||@acb4values and millions of them condemning such violence !!|||||@mostafaihab96 Where are the hundreds of Christians rioting and killing for the defilement of Christ?|||||@acb4values why would they ?? As i believe they take this event proudly !!|||||@acb4values however in islam we dont depict our prophet ... If you would like to mention our prophet then at least respect our religion|||||@mostafaihab96 The real question is where have you ever seen thousands of Christians rejoicing for the killing of innocence?|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan Many attacks on our embassies and other embassies, 1st twin tower attack, USS Cole, but 9-11 final straw!!|||||@acb4values how about we work the other way around two|||||@acb4values lets consider the US attacks on foreign soil !! Lets consider the foreign invasions !! Irak afghanistan ...|||||@acb4values i am sorry but how many innocent american was killed during all those attacks ?? Just a fraction of the innocents killed during|||||@acb4values the invasion of irak or afghanistan !! But you wont consider these innocent muslim people who were bombarded by your military !!|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan is considered a sick person !! In the us school shootings and cop killings happens every couple of months but bcz|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan once again they are lunatics who don't quote 'god is great'|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan but do u consider them as terrorists ??|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan why dont u consider isis as lunatics bcz they are !!|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan BECAUSE THEY HAVE STATED IT IS FOR A NEW ISLAMIC STATE!!! like i said, i know not all muslims are murderers|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan we are arguing about 2 different points|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i am a muslim and i know isis are terrorist and i cant and neither cant my religion explain their action|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan but what i am saying is that other people who arent muslims who commit act of terrorism such as killing kids|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan they r nt carried out by muslims ... They r nt terrorist attacks !!|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan look at there targets. beslan. school in pakistan ,river of blood in syria, kidnapping of young girls in nigeria|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i know all their crimes ... Is it really different from mass murdering children at a youths camp ??|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan NO!! but most of those are condemned . the likes of ISIS seem to get more recruits every day .is that right?|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan and what do you think about these recruits ?? Who are they ?? Arent they the irakis who were bombarded and their|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan families killed by the US for some oil ?? Aremt they Afghanistan people who had millions of their countrymen|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan people are joining ISIS and invading a muslim country, murdering women +kids yet blame the west. no difference|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan i dont blame the west and i certainly dont excuse their actions as terrorists but i might understand their|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan radicalization|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan all people who commit acts that terrorizes should be called terrorist and nt only the muslim ones|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan i agree. IRA ,boko haram,taliban, ISIS, neo nazis are all classes of terrorists.|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan and although i hate to admit ... But u r partially correct ... Unfortunately a big part of the terrorist attacks|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan are carried out by muslims but they radicalized after western attacks on their homes and families|||||@mostafaihab96 @piersmorgan but the middle east has always been at war with itself. my question is why can't people just accept each other?|||||@ljnicholls74 @piersmorgan at war with itself ?? How is that ??|||||@ljnicholls74 look at your own country's history and you'll see how sill you sound|||||@ohffsman so whatever happened to evolution? are we still stuck in the dark ages? why can't people accept not everyone is the same?|||||@ljnicholls74 who's we, the dark ages is a period of time specific to Europe only, you know?|||||@ljnicholls74 you reply makes no sense whatsoever wth?|||||@ljnicholls74 oops.

Billion strong army? You mean a billion Muslims, the large majority of which are peaceful|||||@HA45z @SkyNews It was sarcasm. There is no army. I was making a point to this deluded racist.|||||@Spetts_ @SkyNews oh my, sorry mate. I thought you were talking to me|||||@HA45z @SkyNews Nah, I'm on your side here buddy, haha|||||@Spetts_ @HA45z @SkyNews Islam isn't a race you brainless idiot|||||@lemonscrolls @HA45z @SkyNews okay then, what word should I have used?|||||@Spetts_ @HA45z @SkyNews sensible is the word you should have used|||||@lemonscrolls @Spetts_ @SkyNews "deluded sensible"? And you're calling him brainless?|||||@HA45z @Spetts_ @SkyNews you believe that gays should be hung and you're gonna call me stupid?|||||@lemonscrolls I don't, but last I heard westboro baptist church absolutely loathe gay people. And the biggest twist? They aren't muslims!|||||@HA45z they may loathe gays but at least they don't hang them.Your point is invalid|||||@lemonscrolls you said that I believe gays should be hung, I said I don't? How is my point invalid?|||||@HA45z don't deny the truth go to any Islamic country and say you're gay and they will kill you|||||@lemonscrolls it is forbidden in the Quran to be gay. It is forbidden in the bible too and punishment for it there is also death.|||||@HA45z the difference is Christians don't actually do it|||||@lemonscrolls Yes, apparently they don't follow what God wants them to do, the God they claim is all knowing|||||@HA45z exactly because they realise that it is stupid|||||@lemonscrolls if you choose to believe in God/a religion you cannot just hand pick what of it you want to believe in|||||@lemonscrolls also this discussion is time consuming and going nowhere. Let us agree to disagree and be done with it :)|||||@HA45z agreed.....faze4life|||||@0h_Seriously @HA45z @SkyNews It's a very small number of extremists damaging the reputation of the entire religion|||||@Spetts_ @HA45z the number is not as small as you think..... dont be fooled|||||@0h_Seriously @Spetts_ where did you hear this? The all-so-reliable media? Thought so|||||@0h_Seriously @HA45z or perhaps it's not as great as you think.. Do you want me to believe the majority of Islam followers wants to kill me?|||||@Spetts_ you must travel your own road....................|||||@0h_Seriously so let Islamists travel theirs you idiot, and don't judge a billion people based on the actions of the extremists.|||||@Spetts_ good bye Wing Nut|||||@Spetts_ the media certainly help with that too.|||||@Spetts_ What about extremists in Christianity like the westboro baptist church? Shall I judge Christians based on that?|||||@HA45z I do, I mean the only atheist like this is Richard Dawkins, and even then he's only a bit of a dick, not an extremist|||||@SkyNews All media globally should now print/broadcast #CharlieHebdo material in full|||||@SkyNews that street from 2 angles oddly quiet  Then Hollande turns up at crime scene, security services have no idea where the gunmen are|||||@SkyNews Terrorists don't represent Islam. Even the Koran it says to kill infidels and that martyring yourself is good. Islam is terror imo|||||@StDxCorrosive @SkyNews nicely taken out of context. I could very easily take some very violent verses out the bible and judge Christianity|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive @SkyNews You could. But the Koran specifically says to do these things. I would know, I've read it in World Literature|||||@StDxCorrosive *sigh*. It seems you actually know nothing, http://t.co/vhW19z1gYo|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive Congrats two versus that represent the whole book.

I will have fun proving your ignorance|||||@HA45z My point, is you can't say a blatant verse stating to "kill them wherever you find them" (US, EU, ME) is taken out of context...|||||@StDxCorrosive yes I can because you still don't understand judging by how you still take things out of context. http://t.co/7vbTSJRds4|||||@StDxCorrosive read the article. I'm pretty sure you'll still be ignorant even when you see the truth but I guess thats not my problem|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive I suppose it really means sit down and talk to unbelievers about what it means to serve Allah? If you don't like my|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive opinion on the subject. By all means, block me account so you don't have to see it.|||||@StDxCorrosive your opinion is fine, the ignorance not so much. If you read the article you'd understand the context and why it was said|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive So he replaces the word "them" with "idolaters" and that makes it okay? Yes the bible said kill idolaters but|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive only he without sin can cast the first stone.|||||@StDxCorrosive you still havent caught on. At the time Muhammed and followers were being tortured and constantly attacked.|||||@StDxCorrosive defending themselves seems pretty rational and justified, wouldnt you agree?|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive Defense vs going to another country in another time and killing possibly innocent people is different.|||||@StDxCorrosive Yes you're right, the US government and extremists do do this often. As well as the jews in Israel killing palestinians|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive War could be justified then, but when they set off bombs at a marathon or kill reporters in Paris its uncalled for.|||||@StDxCorrosive we dont know if boston marathon was a hoax by government and in both it was a case of extremists, not true followers of islam|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive and I'm pretty sure it wasn't God who said that it was man.|||||@StDxCorrosive Said what?|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive That idolaters should be stone.|||||@StDxCorrosive you aren't answering my replies that disprove yours and now you're changing the topic to stoning?|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive No, I'm sorry I only saw the other reply. I'll go back and read the other replies.|||||@StDxCorrosive you have to have studied the whole thing, but we are on twitter so unfortunately I can't screenshot the whole Quran, genius.|||||@HA45z @StDxCorrosive Same or I would post the 75+ versus that say "kill them because they don't worship Allah."|||||. @SkyNews @CAPMohan How come folks get Kalshnikovs when I was asked to switch on mobile, remove battery, remove shoes etc for a Transit|||||@SkyNews Absolutely senseless! Don't use the prophet as an excuse for your twisted ideology - #EndViolence Our freedom is NOT an option!|||||@SkyNews These people are professional, no doubt. @mikecane|||||@SkyNews "Avenged"?

We know what it is.|||||@SecularFraud @BBCBreaking And it's been flooding Europe for decades. Political class too scared to act. So electorate moves to the right.|||||@ClearSeer @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking Act by doing what?|||||@MelRJ @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking Limiting mass immigration by backward fascistic peasants with fantasy friends, who hate freedom.|||||@ClearSeer @SecularFraud How would that prevent anyone (or any ethnicity) from being radicalised by say, downloading extreme material?|||||@MelRJ @SecularFraud How come you want to speak to me but block me from replying?&gt; A true believer in free speech, aintcha. Too complex 4U.|||||@MelRJ @SecularFraud Who mentioned ethnicity? You. I think you're a muslim hiding your identity and pretending yo're broad minded.|||||@ClearSeer @SecularFraud And the majority of Muslims in the West were either born here or came here FOR freedom. Collective blame is wrong.|||||@MelRJ @SecularFraud &amp; they have remained in multicultural ghettoes &amp; not integrated. Apartheid, I blame political class who created it.|||||@MelRJ @SecularFraud And you're wrong about most born here, they're still pouring in from Pakistan, tribals in a modern secular society.|||||@MelRJ @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking And if you're looking for a fight, look elsewhere &amp; grow up, not everyone obsessed with Harry Potter.|||||@MelRJ @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking Not everyone seeing dangers of mass migration is rightwing. I was fighting racism before you were a sperm.|||||@ClearSeer 1 You don't know me, 2 Never said anything about right/left wing, 3 it's not about immigration it's about the ease with which...|||||@MelRJ 1. No, you're anonymous! 2. No, but your intro page does. 3. It's ALL about immigration; 5 million in France alone. Germany 2, all EU|||||@MelRJ So many really don't understand the concept of free speech. Immediately blocking anyone who disagrees with them, or worse, criticises|||||@ClearSeer ...any1 of any background can be radicalised by extremists intent on spreading hate. Mass immigration happened to the Americas...|||||@ClearSeer ...to Australasia. What Europe has in comparison is not even close, &amp; most migrants are law abiding &amp; contribute positively.|||||@ClearSeer This collective blame on all Muslims or all immigrants for the criminal few IS bigoted. Deal w/ the ACTUAL perp, not all who...|||||@ClearSeer ...happen to have the same religion, ethnicity, nationality or skin colour.|||||@MelRJ @SecularFraud @BBCBreaking Anyone posing with that silly mask is a juvenile armchair warrior. I fought on the streets.|||||@SecularFraud @BBCBreaking So terrorism didn't/doesn't exist outside of Islam?|||||@BBCBreaking @janeikelboom I pray to God they dont blame muslims. Because terrorism has no religion!!!|||||@nadadictator @BBCBreaking @janeikelboom This one has.

What an embarrassment to journalism!|||||@gr8tale @KHShan @NewYorker It's satirical though.|||||@danielnyari @LauraVanVleet @NewYorker  Thank God Islam is the religion of peace, or they'd have killed two dozen.|||||@DanCChamberlain Be careful your ignorance and superficial views are showing.  @danielnyari @NewYorker|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari @NewYorker Coddle a religion that allows men to marry 12 year old girls, and cut the heads off those who object?|||||@DanCChamberlain Jihadists don't represent every Muslim. &amp; to be so glib about the quantity of people murdered. @danielnyari @NewYorker|||||@LauraVanVleet @DanCChamberlain @NewYorker agreed Laura. Let's not fall into the typical Western neo-liberal/right wing trap here.|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari @NewYorker Glib? It's an atrocity and thank God the cartoonist hadn't upset the methodists...|||||@DanCChamberlain Okay, that made me laugh. @danielnyari @NewYorker|||||@LauraVanVleet I see you retweeted something about anti-bullying, yet you are defending a religion that allows a man to punish his wife?|||||@DanCChamberlain There are many passages in the King James Bible that pretty much say the same thing. I defend no religion, but the people|||||@LauraVanVleet Yes, that argument is often used. We "used" to allow slavery too, but the enlightened have moved on to the New Testament now|||||@LauraVanVleet Just so you know, I'm not religious. I'm just tolerant of all religions as long as THEY are tolerant as well.|||||@DanCChamberlain Tolerance will not educate or make change. Quick naive judgments need more than just tolerance.|||||@LauraVanVleet Yes, quick naive judgements like all police are racists. There is more than enough naivet√© to go around.|||||@LauraVanVleet All religions are not equal. Religions that oppress based on sex, belief, sexual orientation etc cannot be supported. Period.|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari @NewYorker If Islam is a religion of peace, why would its practitioners live in fear of their fellow followers?|||||@DanCChamberlain No organized religion was or is entirely peaceful.

Rhetoric is in heavy supply in your camp.|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet Again the problem with your argument is that it's a blanket statement you can apply to any religion/ideology|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet which remains true. "if christianity is religion of peace, etc". for sake of argument let's presume any|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet ideology can be hijacked. fundamentalism often has nothing to do with religion but with authoritarianism.|||||@danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Daniel, the "fundamentals" of Islam already place "Man" in a position of authoritarianism over woman.|||||@danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Christianity has accepted that woman is a partner. In spite of the Old Testament, Christianity does preach love.|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet Except against Homosexuals right?|||||@danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Wrong. I know of no western religious leader that promotes the persecution of gays. Isis tosses them to death!|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet What about the subject of gay union in the eyes of God? Look, this isn't the point. Yea there might be|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet varying degrees of interpretation of freedom, which is always relative to socio-economic context, etc but|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet when we talk about terrorists THIS good/evil argument is the problem and avoids the fundamental questions|||||@danielnyari @LauraVanVleet The "Fundamental" question is, will Islamic leaders ever recognize the human rights of those who dissent?|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet No it's not. Not in this argument. Because that's not what spawned ISIS and various fundamentalist groups.|||||@DanCChamberlain Recommended reading. "hijacking of Islam by the Taliban" http://t.co/C4Xxw3x1hr @danielnyari|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari Malala is a wonder. The UN pays lip service to her courage and cause.|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari No one "Hijacked" Islam. Islam made it possible to justify horrible acts in its name...|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari If the Catholics started murdering, journalists would immediately point to the Old Testament and say the bible..|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari taught the hate!|||||@DanCChamberlain No death by burning, true, but they make it clear gays are not welcome...  @danielnyari|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari Laura, again, I know of no sane Christian religious leader who preaches hate against gays. No one is excluded...|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari The whole "marriage" vs "union" debate is silly. However, journalists will allow the bashing of Christianity...|||||@LauraVanVleet @danielnyari even embrace it, but they run in fear of bashing Islam...almost religiously! Journalists are a fucking joke.|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet there's an argument for pro-western liberal anti Islam-bashing yes but its inverse also equally deterrable|||||@DanCChamberlain @LauraVanVleet This quick read is gateway into right perspective towards issue i'll leave it at that http://t.co/9BENju8zyd|||||@danielnyari @LauraVanVleet Guys, enjoyed it.

Where is your condemnation of #Islamophobia when you just posted that meme?|||||@Dagan81 @DLoesch  I'm no Islamaphobe, but I detest Jihadis and ANY religious fundamentalists.

No one's perfect.|||||@davegantly He was an opponent of a Fascist dictator &amp; fascism in general. The Kurds appreciated his stance. @stephenfry|||||@Baggerandy I was a fan, on the whole, but listening to him drunk on the glee of war, was hard. He gloats that oil was worth it @stephenfry|||||@davegantly  that's pretty much a definition of ad hominem isn't it?|||||@steviep56 How? I'm a fan, but he supported the invasion and wars that (probably) led to ISIS, so it's fair criticism, surely? @stephenfry|||||@davegantly just thought the article made an argument and you're point ignored that and attacked the man. One doesn't to the other?|||||@steviep56 I was referring less to the article and more to him using his influence to support actions that probably created ISIS.|||||@davegantly seems like playing the man (beliefs on war) and not the ball (religious zealots). Apples and oranges to me.|||||@davegantly as big an ego as he had don't think he ever pretended to be perfect. Was he right on this point though, in your view?|||||@steviep56 I would agree with him, but he used his position to forward a neo con agenda that didn't consider any of the possible outcomes.|||||@davegantly trouble with poss. outcomes is that only hindsight delivers correct assessment. Lots of considering these days, and watching.|||||@steviep56  I recall many mid-east experts saying that if you topple Hussein the rancid bottle will bubble over. It wasn't crazy talk.|||||@davegantly yep, but 'told you so' only looks wise after the fact. Many prophets go very quiet after. So before an act=intelligent belief.|||||@steviep56 I'd accept the 'wisdom gone astray' line, if he hadn't been so blatant about the oil thing. When did he get like that?!|||||@davegantly cause and effect may work in chemistry but in human history so much is choice. In this case choice based on mediaeval theology.|||||@steviep56 but they knew it was there, bubbling away. The brutality has always existed, we just never heard about it. The powers knew though|||||@davegantly which kind of brings us back to his point? No one should be made to silently accept what they believe to be fundamentally wrong|||||@steviep56 I agree with that, but when you're toppling a leader of a country, and undoing a region, you have to be really careful.|||||@steviep56 really, really careful.|||||@davegantly and if you could go back to Germany in the 1930's would you support the care afforded by chamberlain?|||||@steviep56 Not comparable, but yes.  I also wouldn't compare the PM of GB in the 30s to a journalist in the 90s/00s. Hitler was unknown then|||||@davegantly see that's unfair. My analogy was clearly with Hussein and regimes. Much was known about Hitler, much was unknown....|||||@steviep56 No one knew that Hitler was going to try and exterminate the Jews and take over the world. We know about Sharia, etc though.|||||@davegantly Hitlers blaming of the Jews for Germany's ills were widely reported before he gained power. And the policies and implementation|||||@steviep56 Everyone blamed the jews, for everything, but I doubt anyone was advising Chamberlain (et al) that he might want to wipe them out|||||@davegantly were years in the making. Still the world watched in the hope that a greater evil would not be brought on. Sounds pretty similar|||||@steviep56 Extermination wasn't on the cards until quite late in WW2, and kept v.quiet. It wasn't as if it was a poster slogan for elections|||||@davegantly so theory and belief abounded. Only history tells us who was right. But ultimately what has a drunken quip by Hitch got to do...|||||@davegantly ...with whether he is right about the wrong of making sacrosanct the abhorrent views of others?|||||@steviep56 It was his shift from careful consideration to neo-con Yee Haa-ism that struck me. Opinion is fine, but he was off his head here.|||||@davegantly possibly not fair to him. Leaders run that gauntlet every day. To do or do not. But again ain't hindsight grand?|||||@steviep56 but when he asked; "we're entitled to cheap oil, are we not?", was he being cerebral re the consequences?|||||@davegantly and surely the point is it didn't lead inexorably to barbarity that's just the path the loons took.|||||@steviep56 When the loons are an oppressed majority, with revenge on the mind, as they did have, we need to be more thoughtful, no?|||||@davegantly as for ISIS, surely his point is that whatever the effect of Iraq war or any other it should never be that mediaeval barbarity?|||||@steviep56 But it did lead to medieval barbarity. He supported it, and that's what happened. They were 100% wrong, him too.|||||@steviep56 He thought that the Iraqi people would be overjoyed. Were they? No. Only then did he predict the Caliphate. His 'oops' moment?|||||@davegantly  ahhh. Your.|||||@steviep56 If I had said that he himself was a certain type, or whatever, that would have been playing the man and not the ball.|||||@stephenfry @elvis717 Big Congratulations on your upcoming marriage!

838	3	This cartoon by Robert Mankoff from The New Yorker Sept 2012. #CharlieHebdo http://t.co/pyQfnV42Su|||||.@mrjohnofarrell Still not sure what's wrong with being 'politically correct'. Guess some people just love being racist and sexist.|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Some people also love not being murdered for satirising ideas which blatantly need to be satirised, but hey ho.|||||.@JoeMiles94 @mrjohnofarrell I wasn't contesting that. It was the reference to political correctness I was questioning.|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Criticising religion is often seen as unPC, the term is ambiguous. I agree with avoiding racism in satire though.|||||@WadjaKnow @JoeMiles94 @mrjohnofarrell PC as a smear is how the Right attacks human rights &amp; equality. Similar to #shriekingfeminist.|||||@WadjaKnow @JoeMiles94 @mrjohnofarrell "Political correctness" is just a PC way of saying "phoniness." "Enhanced interrogation" is PC.|||||@RModiz @JoeMiles94 @mrjohnofarrell "Enhanced interrogation is pc" &lt;&lt; I'm afraid you're confusing two totally different things.|||||@WadjaKnow @RModiz @mrjohnofarrell yeah, that's a euphemism. completely different thing.|||||@JoeMiles94 @RModiz @mrjohnofarrell two completely different kinds of euphemism, I think you mean.|||||@JoeMiles94 @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell  http://t.co/1vqyEnF32N|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Nothing's wrong with being PC at all, but not being so shouldn't expose you to the risk of terrorist attack|||||.@RobJHarkavy @mrjohnofarrell I don't think the terrorists were concerned about 'political correctness'. Equating the two is, er, snide.|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Well, they appear to have been concerned about being insulted. I take your point, however.|||||@RobJHarkavy @WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell There's everything wrong with being PC, it's brainwashing of the worst kind.|||||.@tristram32 @RobJHarkavy @mrjohnofarrell 'Brainwashing' is a actually a bit of a myth. You're a bit of an idiot.|||||@WadjaKnow @RobJHarkavy @mrjohnofarrell Then I stand with George Orwell on that then.|||||.@tristram32 Don't think Orwell ever used the term 'brainwashing'. A lot of what he says about language and power in 1984 is dodgy.|||||@WadjaKnow So "newspeak" is dodgy?|||||@tristram32 I think the notion that thoughts can be made unthinkable by modifying language is lacking in credibility|||||@WadjaKnow Then you must be living in a cupboard, hear no evil, see no evil, but speaking utter horseshit.|||||@tristram32 Oh i'm sorry I thought you were capable of an adult discussion, my bad.|||||@WadjaKnow Tried that, you appear to be impervious.|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Being politically correct is to pretend living in a world that doesn't http://t.co/PccgrfM0BE should focus on RL?|||||.@JanneKro @mrjohnofarrell What, we shouldn't try to oppose racism and sexism because racism and sexism exist, you mean?!|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell Highlighting issues in society with satire is not racism, it's talking about it. Unlike pol. cor. that does nada.|||||.@JanneKro @mrjohnofarrell Nope, you've lost me there I'm afraid.|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell I drew you a picture. #politically correct text together with #satire. #religion http://t.co/XfYeJStEoi|||||.@JanneKro @mrjohnofarrell Er, nice. Are you opposed to religious freedom then?|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell I'm sorry if you still don't get it. :(|||||@WadjaKnow Political satire is one of the greatest forms of freedom of expression in a free press. #liberty  @JanneKro @mrjohnofarrell|||||.@BhaktiBrophy On the other hand the freedom to shout FIRE! in a crowded theatre must be used very judiciously #CharlieHebdo|||||@WadjaKnow  Having lived thru 9/11, I must say that peace starts with us Let's agree to disagree #Peace To u All! @JanneKro @mrjohnofarrell|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell the problem is you can be proud of who you are unless you're a straight white man|||||.@coyelt @mrjohnofarrell Why on earth would you feel the need to be 'proud' to be a man and white?! That's an accident of birth.|||||@WadjaKnow @mrjohnofarrell be proud of who you are|||||.@coyelt I am proud of who I am, as an individual, in some ways. I'm not taking credit or blame for accidents of birth, however.|||||@WadjaKnow @coyelt @mrjohnofarrell So yer pa accidentally fell over on yer ma and U sprog out?|||||.@coyelt Can you explain to me why you're proud to be a) white and b) a man?|||||@WadjaKnow can you explain why I shouldn't be?|||||@coyelt No, the onus is on you to explain why you hold a certain view, not on me to explain why I don't.|||||@WadjaKnow there's no onus on me. You 'oppose' sexism/racism yet claim my gender/ethnicity is an accident? Double Standards.|||||@coyelt Everyone's gender and ethnicity is an accident. Did you decide to be a white man?|||||@WadjaKnow why is that an accident?|||||.@coyelt You say that you're proud to a white man. I asked you why. That's a reasonable question.|||||@WadjaKnow I can ejaculate &amp; tan (simultaneously if I wish)|||||.@coyelt That is genuinely funny, nice one. But it suggests you're not really serious about being proud of being white and being a man.|||||@mrjohnofarrell WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING THE INUIT WAY OF LIFE LIKE THIS!?!?!! *runs out of exclamation marks*|||||@mrjohnofarrell as a white person I feel deeply offended by this cartoon!|||||@Jensemens @mrjohnofarrell There's that word again "offended" again, do you use it to describe everything?|||||@tristram32 @mrjohnofarrell sorry I don't get your point or maybe you don't get the point I was trying to make|||||@Jensemens @mrjohnofarrell You disgust me.

I don't agree. Both are just as bad.|||||@TheBeanUK @Pray4Pal consider the number of people(including children) dead in gaza caused by a gov ours supports, much bigger|||||@arse_or_brain @Pray4Pal I think we might be arguing over something we agree on.|||||@arse_or_brain @Pray4Pal I would just say the families of each murdered victim in each country are feeling exactly the same.|||||@TheBeanUK @Pray4Pal agree with that to an extent except in gaza the fear of death for yourself or family is greater|||||@arse_or_brain @Pray4Pal that's a different argument all together. Something I totally agree with.|||||@TheBeanUK @Pray4Pal basically i was in no way trying to lessen the pain in France but to heighten the awareness of the desperation of Gaza|||||@arse_or_brain @Pray4Pal I understand, but I don't think that was the motivation of the author.

996	3	TWITTER.  Charlie Hebdo is a racist publication.  Murderers murdering people are not justified in murdering people. Crazy paradox, I know.|||||@leninology Some people just need to get a sense of humour.|||||@leninology so hard for ppl to get heads round. What? You can oppose racism and idiots shooting journalists? Really??! #CharlieHebdo|||||@leninology @FeministaJones hmm hmm|||||@leninology I cannot see why making fun of Islam is in itself racist, though it may be definitely motivated by racism. #CharlieHebdo|||||@johannes_rath context is all.|||||@leninology What about your own tweet and its context? #CharlieHebdo|||||@johannes_rath The context of rabid Islamophobia to which the tweet referred is pretty obvious, no?|||||@leninology You may label anti-cleric jokes stupid,but calling it racist is off the mark, in today's context.|||||@johannes_rath No, it isn't. If the only context you care about is one that excludes the racist demonisation of Islam, you are useless to me|||||@leninology If you want to find out about what I care,check out my posts from the last days.Hint:do some research on #Pegida &amp; #nopegida|||||@johannes_rath If that context mattered in 'the last few days', it matters today.  I have no time for 'a decent interval' etc.|||||@leninology @johannes_rath Islam isn't a race. It's a religion.|||||@BlueMerleBill @johannes_rath name all the races for me. Describe what makes a race. Then we can assess your point.|||||@leninology @johannes_rath I refer you to the dictionary (and not Wikipedia)|||||@leninology @BlueMerleBill There are no human races.Sorting human beings into different races is the very definition of #racism|||||@leninology @johannes_rath if it was the official magazine of the BNP it would have been just as bad. What purpose does your tweet serve?|||||@jlish1990 @johannes_rath "if it was the official magazine of the BNP it would have been just as bad".  Speak for yourself.|||||@leninology @johannes_rath so you're saying that they would be more deserving of death? Troubling implication|||||@leninology @jlish1990 @johannes_rath wow.|||||@MW_Lowe @leninology @johannes_rath I know... Yet to get a satisfactory response.|||||@jlish1990 @leninology I actually agree with the article but these comments really do have troubling implications as you said.|||||@MW_Lowe @leninology what article are you referring to?|||||@jlish1990 the article he wrote about how the media shouldn't use this attack as an excuse to scapegoat Muslims. He tweeted it earlier.|||||@MW_Lowe I only saw a tweet retweeted into my timeline. Will have to find article. Obviously I agree with that sentiment|||||@jlish1990 yes it seems to of been the timing of it that caused all of the furore he is now responding to in a pretty disheartening manner.|||||@jlish1990 @leninology My tweet?|||||@johannes_rath @leninology no not your tweet, the one you replied to|||||@leninology And yet if your first reaction to hearing about the shooting is to tweet that it is a racist mag, that in itself is telling.|||||@theOliJones it is.  It's telling that I think people are tacitly acknowleding that Charlie Hebdo's racism *might* be a factor here.|||||@leninology Might yes. But seeing that tweet people think, why are you saying this in relation to what's just happened...|||||@leninology ...and the only logical conclusion is justification. You could understand why people should find that so abhorrent.|||||@theOliJones "the only logical conclusion is justification".  Of course, that is not logical.  There's a long history of such non-sequiturs.|||||@leninology Why say it then? To offer context? If you think that is the context of these acts you're desperately misguided.|||||@theOliJones I think it is *unquestionably* the context of the media/political response to this.  So so obviously.|||||@theOliJones It's basically a variant of "you're with us or against us".  Well understood reflex of authoritarians.

1032	3	Saying #JeSuisCharlie or "I stand with Charlie" isn't an endorsement of their cartoons, IMO. It's defending right to satirise without harm.|||||@sunny_hundal you may be right but the hashtag still makes me uncomfortable.|||||@NicoleFroio I am no fan of all their cartoons but I think solidarity important in this case|||||@sunny_hundal I feel that it is fully possible to have solidarity for those killed and not endorse the cartoons.|||||@NicoleFroio I agree, and I think for most people saying "I stand with Charlie" is about that|||||@sunny_hundal I sure hope so. Personally the hashtag makes me uncomfortable but it's just a matter of opinion I think.|||||@NicoleFroio Good to know other people are uncomfortable with this hashtag too!  @sunny_hundal|||||@Babytanguera I am very uncomfortable with it, you are not alone.  @sunny_hundal|||||@sunny_hundal @eleanor__p_ it's nice that you think so|||||@sunny_hundal indeed - we are saying no one should be killed for satire or cartoons EVER. It's irrelevant what anyone thinks of them.|||||@sunny_hundal my point on Huff - we are standing up 4 what makes us human. Expressing ourselves freely http://t.co/0uswweUiKz #JeSuisCharlie|||||@sunny_hundal can you satirise the emotions of Europeans regarding Holocaust and Hitler in the same way?|||||@rameez_zafar satirise Hitler all you want. Hebdo did|||||@rameez_zafar @sunny_hundal killing is not acceptable, it's a foolish act and makes people lose respect.|||||@abywitter sure. Nobody can justify the killing.  @sunny_hundal|||||@sunny_hundal Right to satirise without harm is endorsement of all satire, since freedom exists without limitation|||||@tbepublic @sunny_hundal its a contradictory statement.|||||@abywitter What is?|||||@sunny_hundal I'm NOT Charlie, #JeSuisAhmed the dead cop. Charlie ridiculed my faith and culture and I died defending his right to do so.|||||@sunny_hundal It's a defiant affirmation of freedom of speech, (whether satirical or no)  #JeSuisCharlie http://t.co/mzlYihmq2i|||||@sunny_hundal @jonworth any hashtag that's widely used is going to be imperfect and inarticulate. Especially when used for broad solidarity.|||||@sunny_hundal u can stand up for free speech without aligning urself with a mag that satirized the ppl who get backlash from these attacks|||||@CHARL3TTE where did Hebdo satirise Muslims in general?|||||@sunny_hundal I don't have an example but I dont think I need one to say there are better ways we can show support for both speech and Islam|||||@CHARL3TTE I'd like people to show me examples when they say Hebdo was generalising about Muslims.|||||@sunny_hundal that's nice for you but it's not the point.|||||@sunny_hundal And the cartoons should still be published.

1077	3	We strongly condemn the horrible shooting at #CharlieHebdo. We must all stand up for freedom of speech and expression. @Charlie_Hebdo_|||||@alexstubb Ihmeiden aika ei ole ohi.

Making fun/satirising myths, fables, ideas, goes with the freedom of speech. @alexstubb|||||@sandripavli If you're offended by something I say, it's really your problem. Thus "freedom of speach" @alexstubb|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli @alexstubb He is, unfortunately. Bullying shouldn't be accepted in the name of freedom of speech. #CharlieHebdo|||||@markusjuva Bullying??? The whole world should stop questioning (religious) ideas, coz 20% of the people might get offended? @sandripavli|||||@markusjuva I take offence how the Muslims treat women and minorities, yet they are free to preach about it-&gt; freedom of speech @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Pointing out those things, is naturally ok. Involving obscene blasphemy and grossness, is not.|||||@markusjuva Blasphemy!? A law that an omnipotent, omniscient being wont get his feelings hurt. What a joke!! :-D @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli No, a law, that majority of people (and all existing cultures), would have right to have smt sacred still.|||||@markusjuva But since it's a different thing to different people, we'll end up in a society that can't ridicule anything. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @markusjuva One of most important things humans have in common is: difference! Learn to respect that above unilateral emancipation.|||||@sandripavli Viva la difference! But my mouth shouldn't be gagged just because of someone's unsubstantiated beliefs on a "god" @markusjuva|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Gagged and good-taste-and-respectfulness-expected are two different things. Again and still.|||||@markusjuva Not to me. Like I said, people deserve respect, ideas don't.  @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @markusjuva Seems that in you mr.Tuo/mio (yours/mine), you are more mine. I'll leave u 2 gentlemen go on. Markus nice to meet you.|||||@markusjuva I wonder who's doing this and if the people in the market drew a picture? @sandripavli|||||@markusjuva @sandripavli We'll end up with this. http://t.co/zTTrvtsXkq|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli H√∂psis. There should be limits to everything, also to restrictions, but have respect and understanding towards others.|||||@markusjuva There should be limits to things, but not free speech. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli So should one be able to bully as much as one wants in school, because of #FreedomOfSpeech?|||||@markusjuva Again, you're the one calling it bullying. And those students are people, not ideas. And if they say something, -&gt; @sandripavli|||||@markusjuva &gt;to authorities, something will be done. #CharlieHebdo not bullying though, only in your mind. @sandripavli|||||@markusjuva People deserve respect, belief systems/religion doesn't. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Well that's your opinion, and your still in far minority with that "belief". #Luckily|||||@markusjuva In the civilised world? Can you show me some statistics?|||||@TuomoMa Well "civilized" can be seen in far different ways. For me middle class Indian is 100 times more civilized than mid-class american.|||||@markusjuva Well maybe not 100 times, but more civilised absolutely. The U.S. is not on MY civilised countries list. Most of it anyway.|||||@markusjuva @sandripavli http://t.co/pfWmDmU7rS|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli "Everyones beliefs", and the main religions central path, are again those famous #TwoDifferentThings|||||@markusjuva   ----- the point ----&gt;  You.|||||@TuomoMa Not sure what you're meaning here, please explain, got curious.|||||@markusjuva I did, in my next tweet. Besides I'm still laughing at this gem https://t.co/BuZ0oLvUeX|||||@markusjuva You are claiming I should respect all people and their beliefs. I'm saying no, I don't. The Klan believes things too.|||||@TuomoMa We shouldn't accept nor respect wrong or wrong doings, but no reason to insult for example Christ or Muhammed. They did no wrong.|||||@markusjuva I didn't say anything about wrong doings. Don't move the goalposts. We've been talking about beliefs the whole time.|||||@markusjuva And you say we should respect everyones beliefs. I gave you an example. The Klan. Should we respect their beliefs?|||||@TuomoMa No, you have been talking about beliefs, not me. Take your narcissistic head out of your arse and see the outside for a while.|||||@markusjuva Muhammad was a pedophile. Says so in the quran. :-D "Did nothing wrong" haha|||||@markusjuva Prove to me your version of god exists and he's worth worshipping and then I'll consider not ridiculing him/her/it @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli That's not the point, but to respect (also) those who have something sacred in their lives. You can ridicule theories.|||||@markusjuva If believe something, a cartoon shouldn't be able to shake that belief. Nothing sacred about Mohammad. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Nothing sacred to you, but you fail to understand, that lots of sacred to some others. #understanding #respect|||||@markusjuva Nice assumption. Let's say I hold the equality of all humans, men, women, LGBT sacred. Most religions are against that. -&gt;|||||@markusjuva &gt;will you defends me like this when I shoot as many theists as I possibly can? #hypotheticalsituation|||||@TuomoMa The funny thing is (or actually sad), that you still fail to see that I'm not defending anyon, just condemning #CharlieHebdo, too.|||||@markusjuva I get that, but condemning the victim in this case is to me almost as bad. Who are you to condemn them anyway? They broke no law|||||@TuomoMa They are victim for the shootings, but wrong doers in the big picture. Along with other extremists, of course.|||||@markusjuva Again, they broke no law. You didn't answer me, who are you to condemn them, if they broke no law?|||||@TuomoMa Well alcoholics who choose welfare and prostitutes and school bullies might not brake law ‚Äì I still not approve their doings.|||||@TuomoMa You hold it a human right, not a sacred thing. The other things has roots in centuries and millenniums back.|||||@markusjuva Are you saying it can't be sacred to me? Things evolve, we should too. A book written by people who didn't know what stars were&gt;|||||@markusjuva &gt;shouldn't be considered "sacred" anymore.|||||@TuomoMa It's not about the books, it's about God, and in the end, it doesn't make much difference to know the stars, but to know one self.|||||@markusjuva Is it? Which god is that. I'm really more interested why the stars are there, than any book of bull shit.|||||@markusjuva And so should anyone living in the 21st century. We're done with myths, time for facts.|||||@markusjuva You might offend something I hold "sacred", but I'll fight for your right to say it. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli But it seems you haven't anything, and if you did, sincerely, I'd try not to disrespect it.|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli And once again, saying about an issue, or meaningfully insulting about something, are different things.|||||@markusjuva Satire is probably the oldest for of ridiculing the powers that be. Nothing someone says gives the "butt hurt" a right to kill.|||||@TuomoMa Did I ever say, it would give? Are you focusing at all, or maybe drunk?|||||@markusjuva No you didn't. I said how I feel about the subject.  Do you mean concentrating?  Sadly, no I'm not :-(|||||@markusjuva But if you did disrespect it, I'd defend your right to say how you feel about it.|||||@TuomoMa But if I did, I'd do wrong, and the correct thing would be to correct me then.|||||@markusjuva If you broke a law, yes. I wouldn't argue your right to say it though.|||||@TuomoMa Yes, you see the man made laws, not the Divine laws nor even "laws of nature".|||||@markusjuva :-D Stupidest tweet of the day! You want to go with the "divine" law? Sharia? Haha Did you read your tweet before pressing send?|||||@TuomoMa No, I thought you're smarter than that, I underestimated you, sorry. Forget the "Divine" then, just focus on the nature/natural.|||||@markusjuva Hehe, had to come back to this. Can you see the desperation in your tweet? Clasping for straws much? "Divine law" :-D|||||@markusjuva Sorry to come back to this, but have you read Deuteronomy and Leviticus? These are the laws you respect? Or sharia?|||||@markusjuva Exactly, I just point them out, don't go shooting people. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Yup, but these #immoral "artists" at #CharlieHebdo, did much worse things without any taste or limits.|||||@markusjuva "If you don't want your beliefs to be ridiculed, don't have such ridiculous beliefs" - someone @sandripavli|||||.@markusjuva That magazine satirised every major religion and world leader, yet only one of those groups murdered 13 people. @sandripavli|||||.@markusjuva They were even accused of anti-Semitism coz they made fun of Jews. I'm sure the Muslims laughed at those pictures. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Some douchebag might have laughed, doesn't make the pictures right then again.|||||@markusjuva I'd bet quite a few "douchebags" laughed. That makes it hypocrisy. And still they are just cartoons. @sandripavli|||||@markusjuva If your faith/religion is so weak that it can't handle cartoons, no matter what they depict, not much of a religion @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Well the reactions of course vary, only a fool rages, but it still doesn't make severe disrespect correct.|||||@markusjuva Like I said, thankfully disrespect is still included in the freedom of speech. And it ought to be. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli But it's wrong. Why would it ought to be?|||||.@markusjuva Once we start telling what you can and can't say, we no longer have #FreedomOfSpeech That would be a disaster.|||||@TuomoMa So we can bully our class mates now?|||||@markusjuva Really, you should stop with this analogy. It makes no sense.|||||@TuomoMa No it doesn't, it's a "freedom of speech", according to #JeSuisCharlie -people.|||||@markusjuva I didn't forbid you to use it. I said it's a bad analogy, which it is.|||||@markusjuva If someone is attacking beliefs, he has the right to do so. If he's attacking a person, he doesn't.|||||@TuomoMa How many times you want to repeat that low-level belief of yours?|||||@markusjuva As many as I need to. How many times are you gonna mention this non-existent soul?|||||@markusjuva Disrespect of an idea, a belief. There's a huge difference with disrespecting humans. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli How? Why wouldn't for someone spiritual, a belief be more important, than for example looks or other shallow things?|||||@markusjuva I'm not saying it can't be, but if your beliefs are unsubstantiated, I have the right to ridicule them. Not him/her, the beliefs|||||@TuomoMa But for example Christ didn't do wrong, only humans in the name of Him. So ridiculing his character, is tasteless and wrong.|||||@markusjuva Well, if Christ and god are the same thing, as many believe, he did plenty wrong.|||||@TuomoMa Christ is a son of God, as many believes, but lets not get into that, as you don't believe it.|||||@markusjuva Yes, but many denominations of Christianity believe that god, christ, holy spirit all same thing, god. #generalknowledgetidbit|||||@markusjuva Besides, Christ is not the belief system. A Christian god is and according to the bible he's an asshole.|||||@TuomoMa So don't ridicule Christ, ridicule Bible.|||||@markusjuva But the bible is infallible word of god, isn't it? And if j√©sus = god, the bible proves he's an asshole.|||||@TuomoMa No it isn't, I should have known better; you're just one more christian atheist dissapointed.|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Well you can bet and you may be right, but the laughers are fools too, as are the drawers, who crossed many limits.|||||@markusjuva Don't agree. The limits set by Islam? France is not an Islamic country. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli The limits are set by the common sense of the wise.|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Or actually correction here; they are set by Someone else, but can be understood by those wise who have common sense.|||||@markusjuva Again, why should I live by the rules someone randomly thinks of? The law I get, it's thought of and mostly agreed on.|||||@TuomoMa Well that #CharlieHebdo thing should have been outlawed, but yes, if one has common sense, one understands.|||||@markusjuva So that's "common sense" as you define it. Riiiiight|||||@TuomoMa One should find the "rules" from one's heart, then common sense occurs. Not from mind, but heart.|||||@markusjuva Sorry, this is even more stupid than the "divine law" tweet. I'm sure the killers searched their "heart" and look what happened.|||||@TuomoMa Well it's stupid for those who won't get it. I told you, I underestimated you. Forget fairies, think Mandela or Gandhi then.|||||@TuomoMa And no they didn't. One could say "heart full of anger", but digging deep and searching the essence will cleanse it.|||||@markusjuva :-D :-D So you ARE a comedian.|||||@TuomoMa I actually corrected it.|||||@markusjuva Ah :-( So you aren't :-/|||||@TuomoMa Sure I am, but also a philosopher. It was poorly expressed earlier.|||||@markusjuva You must be good.  Now there's some sarcasm for you ;-)|||||@TuomoMa Yes, rudeness is weak mans imitation of strentgh.|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli These things are international and crossing borders anyway. They are actually #universal, but let's stick to earth ;)|||||.@markusjuva If a tribe from Papua New Guinea said that's trees, &amp; subsequently paper, is "sacred" to them, would you stop wiping your ass?|||||@TuomoMa Yeah, I can use water for them.|||||@markusjuva :-D Sure you would! What if you're in a public toilet and there's no water in the booth?|||||@TuomoMa There's probably leafs or someones shirt nearby for help.|||||@markusjuva :-D Someones shirt? Dude, you need to sacrifice yours I'm afraid. No one's gonna give you their shirt at that point.|||||@TuomoMa You reall continue even with this?|||||@markusjuva U said I don't hold anything sacred &amp; I said I do. You know what it is? Paper. Better to keep an extra shirt with u from now on.|||||@markusjuva I mean, you don't want to disrespect my beliefs do you?|||||@markusjuva Btw, if you believe in the bible you're going to hell. You called them fools. Google it, if you can't remember your scripture.|||||@TuomoMa Lol, why would I be that interested what the bible says? :D|||||@markusjuva Don't know, hence the word "if".|||||@TuomoMa Yeah, if you don't know, now you know ;)|||||@markusjuva Good to know.|||||@markusjuva Why would anyone be?|||||@TuomoMa Not many good reasons, though some nice guidelines if one can discriminate.|||||@markusjuva Discriminate??? Do you mean cherry pick?|||||@TuomoMa Of course, who would blindly accept anything, especially dogmas.|||||@markusjuva Apropos of nothing, at this moment a writer is receiving the first 40 of 1000 lashes in Saudi Arabia for blasphemy. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli That's not good, that's wrong, and can be ridiculed.|||||@markusjuva :-D Double standards much? He did exactly the same thing. Blasphemy. He's not dead though. Yet.|||||@TuomoMa I meant that this kind of actions can and should be ridiculed, and for about fifth time, I have never justified any killings.|||||@markusjuva You mean people like this?  @sandripavli http://t.co/spsSDVJWSn|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli No, he's much worse than a douchebag.|||||@markusjuva Agreed. Much worse than anything anyone ever drew on paper. Yet he/she can express her/his feelings. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli But will have to (hopefully) pay it for society, and anyway for his/hers Maker and #conscience.|||||@markusjuva How? She's/he's nameless, faceless? "If" there isn't a maker, who will she/he be responsible to? Do you seriously this his/her-&gt;|||||@markusjuva &gt; conscience is going to give him/her trouble for that? He/She believes he's/she's right. #belief #religion|||||@TuomoMa Yes, it will, no doubt about that, and do not worry my little friend :D|||||@markusjuva I really don't think it will. I doubt he/she believes in your "spirit". Worry? Me? Hah.|||||@TuomoMa "Thinking is no means of knowing the absolute truth"|||||@markusjuva By the way, that's a police officer they're executing.  And a Muslim. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli I know. Tragical, but doesn't make much difference which profession/religion he/she has in this case.|||||@markusjuva No, because he's dead. Killed by another Muslim. Guess they'll meet in paradise, huh? @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Surely not.|||||@markusjuva Why not? He was killed in the line of duty, heroic death. The killer was doing what the quran tells him to do.|||||@markusjuva If anything, the police is not going to paradise. http://t.co/S6zd1tjbqu|||||@TuomoMa Don't believe everything what quran says, and especially, don't believe everything you read from the #internet. #FreeAdvice|||||@markusjuva Ah, another "general knowledge tidbit". I'm starting to enjoy them.|||||@TuomoMa Sure, when you learn to use these in practice, you'll enjoy your life more.|||||@markusjuva Please, stop with the condescending bull shit. You know nothing of me or what I enjoy. #spiritguide|||||@TuomoMa I know a lot already from this conversation, but what prevents you of stopping?|||||@markusjuva Tell that to the jihadists. Who are u to tell anyone what to believe from the quran? Don't you respect their beliefs? #hypocrite|||||@TuomoMa No, I don't exactly respect dogmas, but doesn't mean I'd go insulting them. But the point was not to insult Christ/Muhammed/etc...|||||@markusjuva You just contradicted yourself.|||||@TuomoMa No I didn't, you just won't get it.|||||@TuomoMa But the #Quran was not written by #Muhammed, if you can recall a bit backwards.|||||@markusjuva Again, where did I say it was? Or is this another one of your "general knowledge tidbits"?|||||@TuomoMa Well it is, as you're still referring to quran as it would mean something in our conversation.|||||@markusjuva So the quran had nothing to do with the mindset of the killers? Ah, so you're an apologist. Makes sense.|||||@TuomoMa Probably it did, but Mohammad didn't write it. So ridicule bible and quran, not Christ nor Mohammad. That's my point all over.|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Sure, they can not be killed multiple times. But it's true, there is aggression problem in extreme jihadists.|||||@markusjuva If it truly was a #religionofpeace wouldn't their extremists be extremely peaceful? #islam  @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli In this case not, because of #ingnorance. Holy war actually means war against the enemies of ones #soul.|||||@markusjuva So people can stop calling it a #religionofpeace. Thanks, I'll tell them. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Why? Did you get it wrong what I meant? And why sarcasm, it's again just proof of weakness.|||||@markusjuva No, I understood perfectly. Thanks.|||||@TuomoMa Then your answer was absurd.|||||@markusjuva :-D|||||@markusjuva Prove to me a soul exists. Gibberish. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli The proof is inside of our selves, and only there. Prove it to your self and stop being childish. You'd enjoy it.|||||@markusjuva Prove a negative? Prove something there's no proof of, doesn't exist? Prove to me unicorns don't exist.|||||@TuomoMa I don't have to. But to have proof and knowledge of the #Spirit for oneself, is everything. I sincerely recommend.|||||@markusjuva No you don't &amp; you can't. Just like I don't have to believe in your "soul" coz you can't prove it.|||||@TuomoMa Certainly, but you can give it a chance; find it and realize it, so you don't have to believe, you'll just comfortably know.|||||@markusjuva There, I just gave it chance. No sign of it. You know why? Coz it doesn't exists.|||||@TuomoMa You forgot the consept "sincerety". Must be difficult.|||||@markusjuva Again, just your beliefs. You can believe in this "spirit" mumbo jumbo and I can ridicule it.|||||@TuomoMa Sure, but the happy thing for me is that I don't have to believe in it, I just know it. #Lucky &amp; #Blessed|||||@markusjuva Yeah, just like any theist in the world. "Oh, I just know. He lives in my soul." :-D|||||@markusjuva I guess I'm #lucky &amp; #blessed coz I see the world as it is.|||||@TuomoMa I don't need to guess, but descending for these conversations after your low blows makes me feel bit silly that's true.|||||@markusjuva "aggression problem" That's quite an understatement, but yes, yes there is. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli You can express it better ‚Äì no means to understate, but it's not the core of #Islam nor of the message of the Prophet.|||||@markusjuva Yet these people follow quran more to the letter than a moderate Muslim. The bible is full of hate too. More so @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli #Mohammad didn't write #Quran, #Christ didn't write #Bible. #Islam #Christianity #Dogmas #Ignorance|||||@markusjuva Did I say they did?|||||@TuomoMa No, why you're asking? :D|||||@markusjuva Coz you tweeted all of a sudden this general knowledge tidbit and I was wondering if I had anything to do with this brain fart.|||||@TuomoMa Yup, you had, as you suddenly started brain farting some stuff about some books, and it even lasted some time.|||||@markusjuva Hit a nerve?|||||@TuomoMa Not at all. What happened in between the break, I feel you're getting more lower and lack any kind of essence from your posts?|||||@markusjuva Stop for a second and think. Since there's no law against what they did, you're saying it was ok to kill them? @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Heh, maybe you have to stop now. Where did I say anything like it was ok to kill them?|||||@markusjuva You didn't, there's a question mark. There are laws against spewing shit about people, doesn't apply to sky fairies @sandripavli|||||@markusjuva If you don't want #freedomofspeech to include ridiculing beliefs there are 2 things you can do. 1. Move to a -&gt; @sandripavli|||||@markusjuva &gt; country that doesn't have it. There's plenty to choose from. Or. 2. Try to change things democratically. I'll -&gt; @sandripavli|||||@markusjuva &gt;just say it's a sad day when that happens and then we won't have freedom anymore. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli So should a bully have a right to bully his class mate, because of #FreedomOfSpeech?|||||@markusjuva You're the only one claiming the cartoons were "bullying". They are not. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Really? I'm the only one? #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm|||||@markusjuva First one I've talked to. Why the sarcasm? It makes you look weak.|||||@TuomoMa There's scales and limits in sarcasm, too. This your post has more sarcasm, than the mine you're answering, don't you think?|||||@markusjuva It's all scales and limits with you. Sarcasm is sarcasm, apparently I'm not allowed to do it and you're. -&gt;|||||@markusjuva &gt; but it's ok, we now know you have double standards. #hypocrite #limitsandscalesman|||||@markusjuva https://t.co/7DdxnSYHnj @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli So if a bully bullies also others, anyone shouldn't feel offended?|||||@markusjuva Wow, you got to use the word "bully" twice in this tweet. #notevenbullying|||||@TuomoMa Yeah, and you're being sarcastic two messages in a row and avoiding the point with it completely!|||||@markusjuva There's no point in your bully nonsense. It's a bad analogy. You bully. #seeiusedittwicetoo|||||@TuomoMa But will you be able to answer this, or?|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Sky fairies is your unnecessary rhetorics. For many people some things are sacred, whether you understand it or not.|||||@markusjuva There's nothing to understand. Just unsubstantiated claims. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli That's your belief, for which you have freedom, though it might be silly.|||||.@markusjuva No, it's a fact. Give me a single peer reviewed piece of evidence that proves any of the 3000 or so gods.|||||@TuomoMa It's not a fact, but your belief. The only proof is inside of your soul, and only you can find it, no-one will find it for you.|||||@markusjuva Are you telling me the claims for any god are not unsubstantiated? Go on then, give evidence proving any god.|||||@TuomoMa I've already told, that the only proof is inside one's soul. No use repeating these things over and over.|||||@markusjuva No use repeating this "soul" BS without proof. So you're a "do as I say, don't do as I do" -type of guy, huh?|||||@TuomoMa Another completely failed #CircularArgument.|||||@markusjuva Like I said, first you have to prove a "soul" exists, before you can even advice me what to do with it.|||||@markusjuva Is this "soul" business something they tell you in these "spirit" classes?|||||@TuomoMa No, there's no business and there's no classes.|||||@markusjuva So what's the con then???|||||@TuomoMa Have could I prove you that love, other emotions or for example mind exists?|||||@TuomoMa Like I've said (probably many times), it cannot be proven, but only to one self. Please stop repeating yourself.|||||@markusjuva Repeating myself? You keep bringing up this non-existent "soul".|||||@markusjuva Even though it's actually not a belief, you call call it silly all you want. Because of #freedomofspeech|||||@TuomoMa Sure. On the other hand, I'm also right.|||||@markusjuva No! You're not! #tweetlikeasixyearold Hmmm, maybe you ARE a comedian after all.|||||@markusjuva Bed time for me. Will return. Bye for now. :-)|||||@TuomoMa Same here, need some sleep now.|||||@markusjuva Ok. I think we're done here anyway. I will read your tweets and think about them, but won't comment any further. -&gt;|||||@markusjuva &gt; I think everything's been said and maybe a bit more. I also think it's clear neither of us will change their mind.|||||@markusjuva I'll finish with these quotes from the very smart @aliamjadrizvi Have a good one. http://t.co/hDMnX98WYA|||||@TuomoMa This is not needed. I'm not anyhow justifying the terror attacks and the deaths, just not accepting the martyrism or heroism -‚Ä∫|||||@TuomoMa -‚Ä∫ of theirs, and saying that their "art" was (at least partly) discusting, immoral, not needed, uncalled, non beneficial -‚Ä∫|||||@TuomoMa -‚Ä∫ and what it came to some of the worst ones: extremely insulting and obscenely ugly.|||||@TuomoMa And he seems to be far from smart, when Some who are considered holy and widely loved, can be insulted like that. @aliamjadrizvi|||||@markusjuva If 1 is offended by my views, it's her/his problem. Mute me on twitter. Doesn't give you a right to kill me though. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Sure, there are scales and limits. #CharlieHebdo crossed many, but of course doesn't justify killings.|||||@markusjuva Show me a law that says they crossed a limit.|||||@TuomoMa Same thing, if you search it deep enough from inside your soul, you'll easily understand. But okay; would Mandela agree with those?|||||@markusjuva More of this "soul" thing, huh?|||||@markusjuva Islam forbids one to draw Muhammad. Fine. The people doing the drawing weren't Muslims, so the rule doesn't apply. @sandripavli|||||.@markusjuva If this Allan akubar exists, those cartoonist would suffer forever after their NATURAL death. That knowledge should be enough.|||||@TuomoMa Here you're partly right, and defo it was #incorrect to kill anyone, but to accept what they draw and martyring them, is wrong too.|||||@markusjuva I disagree. And thank goodness, so does most of the civilised world.|||||@TuomoMa Well most haven't (fortunately) seen all the pics, and it's a stupid trend and a rootless ignorance, too. #FreeVietnam|||||@markusjuva Never heard of Charlie hebdo before, now you can not see those pictures. So that worked well. Seen quite a few.|||||@TuomoMa Yes, it's true, everybody lost.|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli I'm not speaking about that. I'm speaking, that it has nothing to do with freedom of speech, but severe bullyism.|||||@markusjuva If they had been doing it only about a single (actual) person the law would have interfered. And rightly so. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli It was still completely tasteless and stupid. Now they are dead.|||||@markusjuva Tasteless? Stupid? Depends who u ask. But they certainly had the right to say it.  Yes they are dead, murdered by theists.|||||@TuomoMa "Certainly had the right"... well, according to you and some others, yes, then again according to some others, not.|||||@markusjuva And according to the law, yes. :-)|||||@TuomoMa Maybe french laws, which is stupid, from #France. #CharlieHebdo|||||@markusjuva So the French law is stupid? :-D Should it be replaced with sharia? #notacomedian|||||@markusjuva If the actions of the cartoonists were lawful (and they were), -&gt;|||||@markusjuva &gt; discussing the content of the cartoons is a lot like discussing what the woman was wearing when she got raped.|||||@TuomoMa Silly argument. But I answered to this already with the alcoholic welfare guy- / prostitue- / school bully example.|||||@markusjuva Bullying a belief? :-D @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Yup, but for someone to whom nothing is sacred, this might be too difficult to understand.|||||@markusjuva Never said that. Just coz I see through the bull shit that is religion, doesn't mean that. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @markusjuva I'm a non religious too &amp; also convinced that religion is bullshit, but people that belong to it aren't full of shit.|||||@sandripavli Never said they are. People deserve respect. Myths, fables and imaginary beings don't. @markusjuva|||||@markusjuva If they had been satirising only Islam/Muslims, I'd kinda see your point. @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Why? Would it make it more right, if Rolle would bully also Niilo and Asko, besides Ismo?|||||@markusjuva Unless Niilo, Asko and Ismo are belief systems, I don't see the comparison. @sandripavli|||||@markusjuva Besides, you're still the only one calling what they did "bullying" @sandripavli|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli I might not know better word, but could write about it more than 140 letters easily. And only one? Knowledge?|||||@markusjuva Ok, only one I've seen so far.|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli You'll see, easily, if you want. It's about hurting someones deep feelings and important sacred things.|||||@markusjuva No, I don't see the point in your faulty "school ground bullying" analogy.|||||@TuomoMa Why not, it's "freedom of speech" to say what one wants, isn't it?|||||@markusjuva I don't know what kind of school you went to, but the school bullies I've seen rarely were into "words" or arguments.|||||@markusjuva That's why, for the umpteenth time, it's A B-A-D A-N-A-L-O-G-Y|||||@markusjuva No one should be silenced in case they might hurt someones "important sacred" thingies.|||||@TuomoMa That's again your belief/opinion. Can you see there's starting to be repetition pattern here?|||||@markusjuva My opinion, the opinion of a civilised society and the way the law sees it. BOOM. Sorry.|||||@markusjuva You're free to try and change it, move or live with it. There's no ifs or buts. No "bullies". Those are your choices. #notsorry|||||@markusjuva Yes I see the repetition. Unfortunately for you, the law agrees with me. Thankfully.|||||@TuomoMa @sandripavli Making fun / questioning, and being excessively vulgar, disrespectful and rude, are two completely different things.|||||@markusjuva Not in my / most of the civilised worlds book. Offence can not be given, it can only be taken. @sandripavli|||||.@markusjuva it's a sign of a civilised country that you can make fun of anyone. Incl. leaders &amp; certainly imaginary beings @sandripavli|||||@sandripavli @alexstubb and who is the one deciding What is offence and What freedom if speech, you?|||||@JuhaVirta1 @alexstubb Not certainly pseudo-cultural or pseudo-intellectual bullism. Who r u, who am I, who r they must nt be above respect.|||||Correct. Bullying shouldn't be approved in the name of freedom of speech. #CharlieHebdo did wrong too. @sandripavli @JuhaVirta1 @alexstubb

1148	3	If I condemn the attack, that doesn't mean I support Charlie Hebdo, and If I condemn Charlie Hebdo, that doesn't mean I support the attack.|||||@BonsaiSky Its all freedom of speech until you criticise gay ppl. We condem the attacks, but going out of your way to offend ppl is big risk|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky It's not a big risk. It's expressing your right as a Western citizen to offend people.|||||@Zeta_zed  @BonsaiSky free speech is not "the right to offend people". What happened cant taint the religion bec true Islam played no part.|||||@LLugein @BonsaiSky Free speech is the right to offend people. The non-offensive speech is easy to defend, this is what's important|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky you need to educate yourself before hastily arguing like this. Silly claim.|||||@LLugein @BonsaiSky "What is freedom of expression? Without the freedom to offend, it ceases to exist." - Salman Rushdie|||||@LLugein @BonsaiSky Standing up for inoffensive speech is pointless. Having free speech means standing up for ALL speech|||||@LLugein @Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky Freedom of speech IS right to offend since non-offensive speech needs NO PROTECTION!Islam is responsible 100%|||||@ritamalika @Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky you lost the argument the moment you threw that generalization in.. Pity|||||@LLugein @ritamalika @BonsaiSky You lost the argument the moment you cared more about people's feelings than expressing free speech.|||||@Zeta_zed Apparently you prefer offensive speech over moral decency. Thus the instigation #CharlieHebdo did. @LLugein @ritamalika @BonsaiSky|||||@ABWDXB @LLugein @BonsaiSky I'm being 100% serious when I say this: go drown in pig blood. You're siding with terrorists you savage|||||@ritamalika Seems you folks are too free in life to be fighting on the right to abuse openly. Absurd argument @LLugein @Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein @BonsaiSky Yes. That is EXACTLY what I'm fighting for. That's what free speech is|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein @BonsaiSky Some things deserve to be offended and mocked and ridiculed,  like your faith in my opinion.|||||@Zeta_zed @ABWDXB  @BonsaiSky thank you sir, for diminishing any influence your tweets may have had with utter hate and ignorance.|||||@LLugein @ABWDXB @BonsaiSky You believe the cartoonists were at fault for publishing cartoons, not the terrorists for being murderers.|||||@LLugein @ABWDXB @BonsaiSky Basically, I don't care what you think. You don't respect free speech, so go move to Iran. You belong there|||||@Zeta_zed If you had not restricted yourself to Cartoons and watch neutral news, you might have a different opinion mate @LLugein @BonsaiSky|||||@ABWDXB @LLugein @BonsaiSky I watch all news you fool. I didn't even know these cartoons existed until these Muzzies murdered the writers|||||@Zeta_zed You hold such extremist thoughts and still don't expect a fall out? You really MUST be delusional. @ritamalika @LLugein @BonsaiSky|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein @BonsaiSky You disgust me. There should never be a fallout from FUCKING CARTOONS YOU SAVAGE. You're despicable.|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein  Don't like them? Turn your head away. Be an adult. You're actually blaming the cartoonists you mongrel|||||@Zeta_zed In your own words, the cartoons were an attempt to abuse and discriminate. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein Abuse? Discriminate? They were cartoons satirizing an ideology, not a personal attack|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein Show me this cartoon you think is discriminatory? There was none|||||@Zeta_zed Ethics dictate no religion is supposed to be made fun of. That said, Terrorism in all form is condemned. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein Ethics?! No, fascism dictates that. There is no ideology that is above satirizing or offending.|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein And until you Muslims realize that, you will never be accepted in the West.|||||@Zeta_zed Oh I'm sorry. I didn't realize the western acceptance is wht I live for. "Gravely" mistaken you are. üòÜ @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein I don't want you in the West. But plenty of Muslims live here, and they need to get that in their heads.|||||@Zeta_zed I agree buddy. Do in Rome as the Romans do. And if the Romans are rude, there are other ways of revenge. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein YOU DON'T GET REVENGE. You don't seem to get that. These are cartoons, not weapons you terrorist sympathizer|||||@Zeta_zed Allow me to start poking you repeatedly. Let's hope you keep a cool head and don't blow it. Hmmm? @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein Cartoonists publishing cartoons is not poking you. They're allowed to take offense and lampoon your beliefs.|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein The World isn't a caliphate so we don't have to bow down to your country and your religion's bullshit.|||||@Zeta_zed Oh please do tell at any point in this discussion did I enforce my any viewport on you? @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein Just letting you know why it is that publishing offensive cartoons is OK in Paris and not in Riyyadh|||||@Zeta_zed My friend, I Condemn all form of extremism be it East or the west. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein Well obviously not considering you're siding with the terrorists and not those expressing free speech.|||||@Zeta_zed Oh lordy Lord I'm condemning both parties for the fiasco. Both parties believe staunchly In their ideologies @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein One party was a group of cartoonists expressing their right to free speech you insufferable cunt|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein The other was a group of rampaging savages letting their sand God dictate their actions|||||@Zeta_zed Well doesn't seem you have much of an open mind either. How are you different from the terrorist? üòÑ @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein By having never harmed anyone in my life you unbelievable fool.|||||@Zeta_zed keep the abuses coming. Keep on judging. A fitting example &amp; use of your freedom of speech. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@Zeta_zed No matter how misaligned they are. Thus extremism is rooting on both sides by some individuals only. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein The cartoonists were not being extremist by publishing cartoons. They were doing their jobs.|||||@Zeta_zed Then consider it as..... A job hazard? üòÜ @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein None of this is funny. You savages murdered 12 Journalists for doing their jobs. You're sick.|||||@Zeta_zed Just as West has its protesters, so does the Middle East, Asia and Africa. You judge a book by its cover. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@Zeta_zed Freedom of speech as you say right. I'm entitled to my opinion after all by your assessment. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein You are. And I'm entitled to draw a cartoon of you being pushed off a train without fear of backlash.|||||@Zeta_zed I would actually like to see it and even pay you if your drawing is any good üòÜ. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein How's it look? http://t.co/OdL9KKPWcF|||||@Zeta_zed Expected nothing more from an atheist like yourself. atta boy. üòè @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein What? Love of bacon and gay rights?|||||@Zeta_zed Haha. Are you targeting the Gay community now? @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein I'm a member of the gay community, and we're constantly targeted by your religion's leaders.|||||@Zeta_zed When you say "My leaders", I assure you no one is my leader. I have my book and God to guide me. @ritamalika @LLugein|||||@Zeta_zed My sympathies at your idiocy and irrationality. @ritamalika @LLugein @BonsaiSky|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein @BonsaiSky I don't care if the guy who is defending the terrorists thinks I'm irrational sorry|||||@Zeta_zed Well buddy. For one I didn't kill anyone. Secondly, how many rich abuses have I thrown till now? @ritamalika @LLugein @BonsaiSky|||||@ABWDXB @ritamalika @LLugein @BonsaiSky Throw one! I won't try to kill you for it. I won't try to punish you for it. I'm an adult|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky I understand, but if you went to somebody in the street and started offending them, there is a risk of them hitting you|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky And the person who gets offended and hits me will go to jail and I won't. That's how our society works.|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky At least in the West that's how it works, I don't know about Pakistan|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky some people will walk away, some will just fight and some will go to extreme lengths and kill you.|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky And you're saying we should capitulate to that violence? That we shouldn't print anything offensive?|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky No, No, NO! I am saying that if your intention is to make money by offending people (muslims, christians, jews etc)|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky and not expect any retaliation, you must be mad! If I go to a black person and call him the N word, they will retaliate|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky I expect that too, but writing a satirical cartoon directed at an ideology is different than a personal attack|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky but who are we to decide if something is more 'personal'? Mohammed is held in high regard, so it is personal.|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky Why openly make fun of people's religion, you had been given warnings, you hide behind police, you know the risk...why?|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky Are you fucking serious? Making fun of ideologies is the cornerstone of free speech.|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky You're allowed to offend. You're not allowed to not be offended. That's the way the Western world works.|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky He's not held in highest regard by me or any other non-Muslim, so we don't have to live by that maxim|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky What is the red line here? how much abuse too far? it is not ok to kill, but you are PROVOKING it. There is a risk|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky The risk is decided by the audience. If they stop paying then you stop working.|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky They're cartoonists! They express themselves through their strips, they're not doing it to make money only|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky And so what if they do make money? The Book of Mormon is wildly successful and offensive. Theres no problem there|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky of being killed, especially after numerous warnings. Also, there is no political point these people are trying to make|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky Yes there is! They're saying Islam is homophobic, that it's intolerant of women, that it doesn't respect speech|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky ok..ok..then why go after Judaism, christianity, buddhism etc?|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky They did you fool, the Jews and Christians didn't try to murder them http://t.co/falfiUpUhK|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky  They can't offend people by say to their faces, but can when behind a keyboard. http://t.co/QivnI5W1XP what is this?|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky yeah there is a huge meaning behind that.lol...take the piss out of people, but actively trying to inflame people by|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky go home man. If you offend people..there is always a risk of alienating them and things may get heated and violent|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky Your mentality is cowardly and capitulating. You care more about other people's feelings than your own rights.|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky WE all have responsibility to treat others like we want to be treated. Simple as that. Now go away.|||||@JakeMiddletons  Stop responding to me if you want me to leave. We all have the responsibility of expressing our beliefs without fear|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky offending their religion is pathetic. JUST DON'T DO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky All of those things are absolutely true|||||@Zeta_zed @BonsaiSky they just want to provoke ppl and get money. If they are standing up for a belief, then I would have sympathy for them|||||@JakeMiddletons @BonsaiSky No they don't. They're publishing political cartoons and you're too dim to see their messages|||||@BonsaiSky If you're not willing to support free speech after seeing the atrocities that your religion's extremists cause then I don't care.|||||@BonsaiSky If you don't support freedom of speech to blaspheme like Chalie Hebdo you are no better than their Islamic terroris murderers!|||||@ritamalika @BonsaiSky what If I'm not Muslim at all n I don't support freedom of speech... Will it count as will?|||||@BonsaiSky Sad as the incident is, Terrorism goes both ways and #CharlieHebdo should realize that.

Nice job. :)|||||@devicerandom Nothing is absolute, you need to keep that in mind.|||||@zipida Freedom of opinion is absolute or isn't.|||||@devicerandom Freedom of anything is not a physical entity/law, it's a privilege. Hence not absolute.|||||@zipida My point is logical. Freedom of opinion requires, *by definition*, its absoluteness. Otherwise you are no more free.|||||@devicerandom No it doesn't. And no you're not "free" at least in physiological sense.|||||@wikileaks why do you want to gratuitously offend ordinary muslims ?|||||@xtc_uk @wikileaks Oh hello terrorist sympathizer :)|||||.@wikileaks maybe they think it wrong to publish offensive racist images designed to offend as many Muslims as possible?|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks They are not racist. They mock religion and extremism. And they are required to know context.|||||@devicerandom whole point of the cartoons is to attack Islam in the most offensive manner, what context is that not hate speech? @wikileaks|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks Hate speech is different from racism. And attacking a religion is attacking a conceptual system, not a race.|||||@devicerandom @wikileaks so anti Semitism is not racism?|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks Antisemitism is racism because there is a strong intertwining between Jewish (ethnicity) and Judaism (religion).|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks However mocking the Jewish *religion* is not antisemitism. Mocking the Jews as an *ethnicity* is.|||||@devicerandom I'm glad you can tell the difference coz most Muslims/Jews can't @wikileaks|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks What do you mean? And is Muslim a "race" now? That intertwining is typical only of Judaism.|||||@devicerandom @wikileaks http://t.co/PibaJzZnji|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks This is mostly OK but changes nothing. I am not anti-Muslim. Islam is just a label. *All* religion is the problem.|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks I do respect individual peaceful Xtians, Muslims, Jews etc. I do not have to respect dangerous Neolithic beliefs.|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks And that is my point: freedom to mock, offend and discuss philosophies and ideas, all of them, including my own.|||||@devicerandom there's no such thing as 'race' its a political construct - there's only 1 race and that's the human race @wikileaks|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks That is why I talked about ethnicity, not race.|||||@devicerandom @wikileaks there has been a racist campaign against Muslims in many ways similar to the demonisation of Jews in the 30's|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks I know well and it's disgusting. But: one thing is not being discriminatory a priori against Muslims. Another...|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks ...is to be able to criticize, mock or despise religious (like political, like philosophical) beliefs.|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks I know it's a delicate line, no one denies that. But it's necessary. IMHO religion deserves no intellectual respect|||||@devicerandom if it had been child pornographers that had been murdered we wouldn't be upholding their freedom of expression would we?|||||@devicerandom @wikileaks these cartoons are part of a campaign of portraying Muslims as being 'apart' from society|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks You know the background of CH people, do you?

Including the freedom of being antireligious openly and harshly. Again, please check.|||||@duncanbrown4 Defending freedom of religion is not the same as endorsing religion or holding it as sacred.|||||@devicerandom saying Islam is a terrorist religion is not defending freedom of speech|||||@duncanbrown4 Well, people should be free to say it (and I to disagree harshly).|||||@devicerandom the are more difference between individuals than between 'races' @wikileaks|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks Yup (even if Lewontin fallacy, but whatever), but what has this to do with the discussion?|||||@devicerandom @wikileaks oh yes the great Western values, up held by the CIA in Abu Graib|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks This is the same retarded reasoning of those who equate Islam with terrorism, only mirrored.|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks Abu Ghraib is quite the opposite of what I am defending here: peaceful free expression for all.|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks You are antifascist (like me). Do you consider yourself racist because you speak against fascism and you mock it?|||||@devicerandom its not hard to utterly condemn the murder of journalists and oppose the circulation of racist cartoons @wikileaks|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks Sure thing but there is nothing racist here. Religion is not a race. I despise Christianity, Islam, Buddhism etc.|||||@duncanbrown4 @wikileaks Also, you can publish them to give the context, even if you disagree with them.

1422	3	Response to horrific #CharlieHebdo murders should be to protect civil liberties not limit them. Not an excuse for more mass surveillance.|||||@OpenRightsGroup @SamirAllioui Sad that people are using #CharlieHebdo as an excuse to push more surveillance. That's not the answer.|||||@OpenRightsGroup Also, being anti-religion is not same as being racist. You can't change colour, you can change religion. It's fair game.|||||@OpenRightsGroup @JackofKent The tragedy is that allowing the next attack will bring inevitably the far right to power. Inevitable?|||||@openrightsgroup @somesheep  i confess i'm not seeing the logic here. i certainly don't want to limit h.r. but how will that help here?|||||@RonJeffries You think increased surveillance is the sensible consequence? (I expect I misunderstand your objection.)|||||@somesheep i do not favor reducing civil liberties but i don't see how protecting them would have prevented this tragedy.|||||@RonJeffries I think the point is more that increased surveillance (as it exists in France) has not protected in this case.|||||@RonJeffries My personal view: ‚ÄúI am Spartacus‚Äù, i.e. publishing such cartoons everywhere, exercising the freedom =&gt; Too many targets.|||||@RonJeffries In the UK, currently, publishing such cartoons is legally considered a ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù. So rights are already curbed.|||||@somesheep didn't stop the crime, though. what would help with that aspect?|||||@RonJeffries I don‚Äôt think UK legislation helps, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. I think it‚Äôs 100% wrong.|||||@somesheep i favor freedom but i don't see how more freedom would reduce the chances of such a thing|||||@RonJeffries If there are only a few lone voices exercising these freedoms, they make easy and symbolic targets.|||||@RonJeffries This act was not about ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù but about intimidation. ‚ÄúWe can shut up the few.‚Äù|||||@OpenRightsGroup Stand in solidarity with Paris.

1426	3	The #CharlieHebdo shooting is an act of terror - violence with a political motive - but well within our existing threat assessment.|||||@PJCrowley are you calling for sanctions on the Saudis they are at the root of much of this radical Islamic terrorism?|||||@fnsrle Wahhabism is a factor, but the challenge is broader.

They do appreciate it.|||||@MaxD17 @stephenfry I'm sure their grieving friends and families are comforted. #Pointless|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry And you acting like a holier than thou douchebag is helping so much? Get real. STFU.|||||@BaKaiyaTeru @MaxD17 @stephenfry Really intelligent comeback there. Well done üëè|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry you're kidding, right? These guys lived to make  comics - continuing their work is what they would want.|||||@tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry 'comics'?? Really? They intentionally set out to cause offence and the French govt explicitly advised them|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry so you're saying it's okay that terrorists killed 12 people because they disagreed with free speech?|||||@tom_wigmore_ if you read the second part of my tweet, you'll see I in no way condone that and it's horrific.|||||@totalkharnage but you are saying we roll over and allow the terrorists the freedom to kill, as free expression should be repressed, no?|||||@tom_wigmore_ no. Everyone should and has free speech but most people use that responsibly. I have the right to shout Fire but don't do so|||||@totalkharnage you're missing the point of satire. It's supposed to be borderline comedy. Those who take it otherwise need thicker skins.|||||@tom_wigmore_ Not sure ending up dead and being firebombed is worth the laughs but that's a decision every person makes themselves.|||||@totalkharnage Death is the extreme. But these cartoonists stood for what they believed in the face of adversity. That's admirable.|||||@tom_wigmore_ Oh give me a break. Just mindless platitudes that are used in the papers and news to make them look like heroes. Total tripe|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ Are firebombs and bullets are a worthy response to satire? Are you actually implying people should be silent?|||||@solastary @tom_wigmore_ No &amp; no. You can disagree, be offended and not advocate violence. A distinction that some on Twitter find difficult|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ 1. Then go out there and teach your young men what is a worthy response. Teach them that firebombs...|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ 2. ... And bullets are not the answer. Go to your mosques and root out the ones preaching violence.|||||@solastary @tom_wigmore_ Oh dear god. 'Teach your young ones' sorry but there are 1.6 billions Muslims in the world, what % do you think|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ 1. A very tiny one. But one which has had a huge impact on ppls lives. I do not support the issues which...|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ 2... Make extremists kill, yet people like me are affected by the attacks. You have the responsibility...|||||@solastary @tom_wigmore_ few nutters is stupid and illogical. Move one.|||||@solastary @tom_wigmore_ are terrorists. You make it sound like most young Muslims are terrorists which is what some in the media peddle.|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ you do know us lot in Europe have been brought up with the ideal of free speech? Its our right!|||||@Themightydodgy_ @tom_wigmore_ I was born &amp; bred in the UK so when you say 'us lot in Europe', I'm one of you. Stop being offensive.|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ well get on the same page then.|||||@Themightydodgy_ @tom_wigmore_ Why should I?? So because I disagree with your point of view, I'm not 'one of you'?? We live in a democracy!!|||||@tom_wigmore_ on a crowded train or theatre. What did they gain by doing this when no other publications did?|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ they set out to make a point. They did.|||||@MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ Which is?|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ they published hundreds of comics. I'm sure you're savvy enough to extrapolate some meaning from a few.|||||@MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ Help me because I fail to understand it.|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ a few points I can see -religions are hypocritical. Politicians (at least some) are corrupt. Etc. multiple.duh?|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 "fuck you, oppression".|||||@totalkharnage by saying something no one else would. They spoke out and continued through oppression. And now the world looks on agreeing|||||@tom_wigmore_ And what were they saying other than causing offence, intentionally?|||||@totalkharnage It's SATIRE. Would you have this much angst against The Onion? They had messages to say, and they told them.|||||@tom_wigmore_ Why is it difficult for you to understand that I don't have to agree with everything the Lord @stephenfry says? Move on.|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry I'm not saying agree with Stephen Fry, at all. I'm saying realise that you're apologising for terrorists.|||||@tom_wigmore_ @stephenfry Oh dear god. So thinking the cartoons are stupid is apologising for terrorists? There goes any logical argument.|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ And here, in a quiet corner of Twitter, is the problem entirely.|||||@StanleyBurgoyne @tom_wigmore_ What's the problem with disagreeing with someones point of view and why are you so offended by that?|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ you fucking imbecile. To talk of 'offence' in the face of murder. There speaks the voice of moderate Islam.|||||@StanleyBurgoyne @tom_wigmore_ another intelligent response.  Glad you exercise your right of free speech. Blocked.|||||@tom_wigmore_ @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry Fuck you islam, fuck you christian, fuck you invisible friend illness spreader.|||||@RaAmarr1 @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry Again, intelligent comeback. Well done.|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry Awww. Are you offended? Are you !slam? You must be. I have two words, can u figure them out|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry btw what's yours? Don't piss of religion of peace, they might kill you?|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry Its your choice to take offence. Make better choices.|||||@kirstym01189085 @totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry absolutely agree. Saying "I disagree with your point" is okay - massacre is not.|||||@tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @MaxD17 @stephenfry Agreed and no sane person would say otherwise but that's the point, the terrorists aren't|||||@totalkharnage @kirstym01189085 @MaxD17 @stephenfry but you're still missing the fact that if we hide the posts, the terrorists win.|||||@tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @MaxD17 @stephenfry Win what? And what do we gain?|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry they want to instill fear.To dictate our lives. Silencing free speech is surrender|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry what if I'm offended that women are allowed to speak out of turn?|||||@MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry Feel free to be offended and I defend your right to feel such way and speak out about it.|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry don't the cartoonists have the right to speak out about religions then?|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @stephenfry the whole world is offended by what happened the offensive part was death.|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 @tom_wigmore_ @stephenfry Defend your right by using guns and killing people. Grow up. Satire is healthy in society|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @kirstym01189085 @MaxD17 @stephenfry Terrorists follow an ideology rather than having a mental illness.|||||@robinandlindsay @totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry They use religion to control. They are fascists. We need humour|||||@totalkharnage @tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry It's your choice to take offence. Make better choices.|||||@tom_wigmore_ @MaxD17 @stephenfry on numerous occasions not to do it. None of which condones in the slightest what the terrorists did tho|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry biggest insult to their memory would be to concede to fear as the terrorists want. Spread the pix to honor them|||||@MaxD17 @stephenfry But in the process, continuing to offend Muslims. I agree with this view http://t.co/021W5I8115|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry It sounds like you are happy they were shut up. People who kill over a cartoon are the problem, not the cartoon.|||||@BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry it 'sounds' like I'm happy?? What planet are you on. You sound like George Bush 'with us or against them'|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry You keep blaming the victim, maybe you want to look into that first.|||||@BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry I do think they were incredibly stupid but again, nothing justifies terrorism. Nothing.|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry That they were "stupid" is irrelevant and an insult to them. Maybe they were just braver than you.|||||@BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry 'Braver'. One mans bravery is another mans stupidity. Idolising them now they're dead is easy to do.|||||@totalkharnage @BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry Funny u say the "with us or against us" line. I know a religion that says the same. 'Kill infidels'|||||@ZebraPinstriped @BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry Read the Old Testament lately? http://t.co/uQBT3RF0zl|||||@totalkharnage @ZebraPinstriped @BaKaiyaTeru looking to the day 99% of muslims treat scripture same way 99% Christians &amp; Jews treat theirs.|||||@docslacker @ZebraPinstriped @BaKaiyaTeru Exactly my point.|||||@totalkharnage @docslacker yes, religious books are crap including OT. Real problem is all follwers think there's not a word wrong in Q book|||||@totalkharnage @docslacker The day ppl r ready to admit portions of these books could be wrong &amp; outdated, the world would be a lot better|||||‚Äú@totalkharnage: @ZebraPinstriped @BaKaiyaTeru @stephenfry Read the Old Testament lately? http://t.co/RvMJE6Jv5w‚Äù|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry offend them more. Offend Christians, atheists, Jews, Asians. Makes no difference.Who cares that they're offended?|||||@MaxD17 @stephenfry what do we gain other than offending mainstream people?|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry why should there be another objective? Offense can be their objective and still be valid.|||||@MaxD17 @stephenfry And I reserve the right to be offended and to speak up. Why is that difficult to understand? Not advocating violence tho|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry you are saying we should censor the images or at least their spread, because it is offensive. That is the issue|||||@MaxD17 @stephenfry Again, do not see what is gained in the slightest from this at all. Why have many publications not published them?|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry no one is forcing them to publish anything. You are either trolling or quite illogical in this it seems.|||||@MaxD17 @stephenfry Not trolling mate. I think you can be for free speech, against terrorism and still not republish the cartoons. Simple.|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry then you're just wrong.|||||@MaxD17 @stephenfry And that's your point of view. I disagree. End of civil conversation.|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 then you missed the point of #FreeSpeech if your claim a god exists like Thor, Ra or allah without offering proof|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry You should be more offended by those who use your religion to firebomb and kill.|||||@solastary @MaxD17 @stephenfry And why can't I be both? It's not a zero sum game. Again, you can be against both although I place murder|||||@totalkharnage @MaxD17 @stephenfry If you are go out there and do something about it. Start reaching out to those angry young men.|||||@solastary @MaxD17 @stephenfry much higher up the list than publishing some stupid, thoughtless cartoons.|||||@totalkharnage @solastary @stephenfry they were not thoughtless. You don't get it. Never will.|||||@MaxD17 @totalkharnage @stephenfry|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry - it shows how feeble some folks are. Getting offended over a cartoon and then killing for it.  that is insane!|||||@Greyhound1405 @stephenfry I totally agree.|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry doesn't show dead people anything. Shows terrorists that they won't silence ideas. Shows solidarity w/ survivors.|||||@docslacker @stephenfry And continues to offend mainstream Muslims. It was and is 'stupid' http://t.co/021W5I8115|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry so what. No one has the right to be protected from being offended. Charlie Hebdo also satirised Jews &amp; Christians|||||@docslacker @stephenfry Did they have a special edition satirising Christians and Jews? They intentionally targeted Islam to get publicity|||||@totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry Yes.  Next question, or are you just going to keep being an ignorant apologist?|||||@BaKaiyaTeru @docslacker @stephenfry  apologist for what? Just because I disagree with the cartoons makes me an  apologist for terrorists?|||||@totalkharnage @BaKaiyaTeru disagree with the cartoons. But what can you expect when you criticise people for refusing to be silenced?|||||@totalkharnage take 5 minutes to google Charlie covers. Their take on the Christian trinity and homophobia is pretty harsh.|||||@totalkharnage their covers lampooning Catholic Church hypocrisy, the inability to criticise jewish extremism, etc...|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry the answer is more speech. Speak out, speak out against terrorists who hijack your religion.|||||@docslacker @stephenfry You mean like all the major Muslim nations have? http://t.co/EfTEsokdbX|||||@totalkharnage and I am glad and hopeful Arab and Muslim leaders are speaking out. It is a turning point. I want to support moderates.|||||@totalkharnage @stephenfry you can't say a religion is a religion of peace and love and then threaten to kill those who insult it.|||||@totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry tough tatties if people take offence, it's satire. That's the point. No need to look if it's annoying|||||@Boulton101 @docslacker @stephenfry Agreed. I take offence but I'm not about to commit murder. People disagree, it's a democracy. Move on.|||||@totalkharnage I will defend your right to belief what you want. I will stand against those who want to impose their beliefs on others.|||||@docslacker No problem at all with that.|||||@totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry was literally the point myself and others were making to be fair...|||||@totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry That sounds like a threat.|||||@PatrickRomSim @docslacker @stephenfry how so?|||||@totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry Uh...ok. Guess that says it all right there.|||||@PatrickRomSim @docslacker @stephenfry because I accuse them of being stupid, means I'm threatening them? You must have a really thin skin|||||@totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry Basically u are saying if u continue to offend Muslims u r stupid &amp; deserve any repercussions.|||||@PatrickRomSim @docslacker @stephenfry Erm, no. That's what YOU just said. Why continually assume I mean one thing when I said the opposite?|||||@totalkharnage @docslacker @stephenfry whatever, back track all you want, you still come off as a terrorist sympathizer &amp; apologist.|||||@PatrickRomSim @docslacker @stephenfry aaaaaand we finally get there. Took your time. All boils down to that in the end.|||||@stephenfry Abhor many of them but obviously abhor murder far, far more|||||@stephenfry http://t.co/urzHYPKO8S|||||@stephenfry Huge respect to the @HuffingtonPost for printing them - we need every news company to do the same.|||||@stephenfry may I suggest it's time to repost your comments on taking offence? They seem very apt.|||||@stephenfry given one the police officers murdered was a muslim, should cartoons that could offend his family be reposted?|||||@MJIBrown @stephenfry That question is offensive bro.|||||@BonnettJosh @stephenfry not a rhetorical question. I care about freedom of speech &amp; the policeman's family, so the issue troubles me.|||||@MJIBrown @stephenfry We can't be cowards. They are drawings FFS.|||||@BonnettJosh @stephenfry absolutely. A heinous crime and expression of ideas must be protected. Being respectful is a choice.|||||@MJIBrown @stephenfry Muslims are the greatest victims of their own silly religion.|||||@BonnettJosh @stephenfry given contrast between the muslim terrorist &amp; muslim policeman, I'm avoiding sweeping generalisations.|||||@BonnettJosh @stephenfry people should be free to repost the offending cartoons, but is this a reasonable thing to do?|||||@MJIBrown @stephenfry Anything less gives in to islamist insanity.|||||@BonnettJosh @stephenfry right. Respect freedom of speech but also choose to respect the policeman's family (and other law abiding muslims).

Islam is terrorist ipsofacto|||||@TristanWhoisit this thought you express here is incompatible with the tenets of Islam|||||@mortimerzilch Murder is incomptatible with ISlam, In the Coran I read|||||@TristanWhoisit you got that wrong. either you are lying. reading selectively. deliberately misinterpreting. RETRIBUTION is demanded !|||||@TristanWhoisit @CERN Is it okay to lampoon the Prophet without retribution? Do you approve of it?|||||@mortimerzilch @CERN is it okay to assassinate for a draw ? In France we have a "judiciary system".|||||@mortimerzilch The muslim authority of the country attacked Charlie in court. They lose, but they had the right to do so|||||@CERN it's a tenet of Islam to DEMAND respect, or else, death. So, if your support Islam you support sharia, and/or "justifiable" pay back.|||||@mortimerzilch As a matter of fact it's not immutable. Much of it is interpreted in various ways. @CERN|||||@Jason___Jones @CERN well that's what the various branches of Islam are supposed to be about...but it's not showing up within Islam!|||||@Jason___Jones @CERN "moderate" Islam is a sham; it has folded it's tent and gone away. There is no discernible schism with the terrorists.|||||@mortimerzilch If that were so then the majority would have acted more forcefully, not a rabid minority.Their intent is to divide @CERN|||||@Jason___Jones @CERN sorry, just not enough condemnation coming from within Islam. They condone and are complicit...that's key to ISIS.|||||@Jason___Jones @CERN ALL the key points: honor killing, sharia law for non-Islams, etc etc.must be REJECTED categorically by Muslims.|||||@Jason___Jones @CERN or else they must be ejected from OUR society. So do you really think that will happen? So, then, what comes next?|||||@mortimerzilch The notion of 'our' society is fast becoming outdated. We live in a globalised world.

Negotiate with a gun? how?|||||@Jason___Jones @CERN ty Jason for the great tweets and discussion.|||||@mortimerzilch One final thought. Separating religion proper (Islam) from religion as political toolo (ISIS) matters. @CERN|||||@Jason___Jones @CERN how is it possible to do that? It's not in this case. Form and matter cannot be separated.|||||@Jason___Jones @CERN Religion is not an abstraction...it exists in its adherents. And that's what WE in Western Civilization encounter now.|||||@mortimerzilch @CERN The difference is aim. ISIS wants to create a radical state. To normalise extremism. The majority reject that.|||||@Jason___Jones @CERN I think you are not close enough to the situation.

People need to know the truth.|||||@nodogma1 @MetroUK From Merriam-Webster... Dogma: a point of view or tenet put forth as authoritative without adequate grounds|||||@nodogma1 @MetroUK ... That definition applies, just as well, to atheism, as it does theism...|||||@BenReclused @nodogma1 while I can't speak for this guy, I'd say most atheists critique religion because it has such a large impact-|||||@BenReclused @nodogma1 -on how we live our lives, the law, community, and obviously the few zealots that pop up like in #CharlieHebdo|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 All ideas should critiqued. That's the only way to insure validity. That's not the same as ridicule, though|||||@BenReclused @nodogma1 so where, in that, do you draw the line betwixt the two? Because it is a very razor thin line to a lot of people.|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 If one compares the definitions of "critique" and "ridicule", there is, indeed, a lot of contrast between the two.|||||@BenReclused @nodogma1 I'm aware, but a lot of people aren't.|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 Well... It'd be better to educate them, than to stir them into a frenzy...|||||@BenReclused @nodogma1 I'm actually not aware of anyone but conservative news anchors attempting to 'stir the frenzy'|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 I don't know where the Hell you've been, but I see shit being slung from ALL directions...|||||@BenReclused @nodogma1 I'm sure|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 If you don't see it, it's only because you don't want to...|||||@BenReclused @nodogma1 If someone doesn't like a critique or if the delivery is too blunt it is labelled ridicule.|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 Though unfortunate, that is, indeed, true... I experience that, quite often...|||||@BenReclused @nodogma1 then why are you even disagreeing with me here.|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 I'm not disagreeing about that... But that doesn't make it proper... Why are you trying to justify it?...|||||@BenReclused because it happens on both sides. To err is human, atheism specifically isn't the culprit|||||@nicothegreat17 I never said atheism was the only culprit... It's only one of many, groups, that are stirring up hatred...|||||@nicothegreat17 If ridicule for okay for one, it should be okay for all. Do you feel that it's acceptable to ridicule LGBTs? I don't...|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 All that ridicule does, is encourage more hatred...|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 ... Here, in the United States, religion doesn't effect our lives, nearly as much, as many claim...|||||@BenReclused @nodogma1 abortion, gay marriage, reeducation facilities, general bigotry by a WIDE minority|||||@nicothegreat17 @nodogma1 Most of that's media hype, and politicians pandering for votes... One hears about it lot, but that's about it...|||||@BenReclused REEDUCATION COMPOUNDS ARE NOT HYPED. The fact that you would even insinuate that this is not a thing is disgusting|||||@BenReclused Watch the documentary 'Kidnapped for Christ' and then come back here and tell me about the politicians who hype it.|||||@nicothegreat17 How many people have you known, personally, that have been "Kidnapped for Christ"?... I've never met one...|||||@BenReclused We just shouldn't mind it then? A few thousand people suffer, but what's that, really? It's not like we've gone to war for less|||||@nicothegreat17 Now you're asking about things, that I didn't even insinuate... You seem to think you're mind reader... Are you?...|||||@BenReclused Well I'm done talking to you until you actually have an idea about what you want to say|||||@nicothegreat17 Hell... You didn't express any ideas... All that you did was attempt to justify ridicule, and demonize me...|||||@nicothegreat17 ... Quite honestly, I don't give a shit if you return, or not... You're not near as important, as you seem to feel you are.|||||@BenReclused @nicothegreat17 We've met THOUSANDS. There are more still.  Many of them follow us and would be happy to educate you.|||||@kidnpd4christ @nicothegreat17 I'm not interested in attending one of YOUR "Reeducation Compounds"... I have other fish, to fry...|||||@BenReclused @nicothegreat17 Unfortunately, turning a blind eye doesn't mean atrocities aren't happening to others, daily.|||||@kidnpd4christ @nicothegreat17 Compared to over 300 million people, "THOUSANDS" are only needles, in a barn full of hay...|||||@BenReclused @nicothegreat17 We've meet thousands, there are in fact a couple million, since the introduction of these camps. But, good luck|||||@kidnpd4christ @nicothegreat17 It seems that you have a lot of work to do. So you'd better get after it...|||||@BenReclused @nicothegreat17 We've already started. Hopefully,  Milt, you're actually doing something, other than arm chair tweeting.|||||@kidnpd4christ @nicothegreat17 ... And, I'm more concerned about the "hay" than the needles... So, I'll leave that search to you...|||||@BenReclused @nicothegreat17 Ignorance is bliss.|||||@kidnpd4christ @nicothegreat17 I have no doubt, that you would know...|||||@BenReclused @nicothegreat17  visit http://t.co/97C8CgGMjI for more.|||||@nicothegreat17 Now, you're taking my words of context... They're not as common here, as one is lead to believe...|||||@BenReclused 1. That they're common anywhere is horrendous|||||@nicothegreat17 I agree... And, they should be shut down...|||||@BenReclused so the evangelical church should subsequently be shut down as well, as the people behind it.|||||@nicothegreat17 No... Not all Christian churches condone such... And, I was only referring to the "compounds"...|||||@BenReclused 2. The fact that any exist is a crime|||||@nicothegreat17 See my previous tweet...|||||@BenReclused 3. Regardless of their domestic scarcity, the operate without reproach.|||||@nicothegreat17 As I said, they should be shut down...|||||@BenReclused are you getting these like 20 minutes late?|||||@nicothegreat17 No...

Political ideologies. Prophets. Famines. All up for grabs in a healthy democracy. No bans No deaths|||||@HisEmineminence @NiallODowd would you like a comedy about something u find very sensitive and maybe even personal?|||||@Irish_Fart14 @NiallODowd No. But I'm a grown up. I don't have to. By the same token, I wouldn't sign a petition to ban it, as has happened.|||||@HisEmineminence @NiallODowd so you wouldn't sign a petition against a comedy being made about something very sensitive to you?|||||@Irish_Fart14 @NiallODowd No. If it's crap, it'll vanish anyway. If everybody loves it, I'll argue they're wrong. Banning is for dictators.|||||@HisEmineminence @NiallODowd I find that very hard to believe....|||||@Irish_Fart14 @NiallODowd Well, that's sad mate. I was always told to ignore bullies. Works the same for something you feel is offensive.|||||@HisEmineminence @Irish_Fart14  what is amusing is so many of the civl libertarians on this issue were fully behind section 31 ban on SF|||||@NiallODowd @Irish_Fart14 Really ? Wow. Well, I was 11, didn't live in the UK and wouldn't have known what civil libertarianism was. But,|||||@NiallODowd @Irish_Fart14 even to my childish eyes, it struck me as ridiculous. You still heard what they had to say. Your point ?|||||@Irish_Fart14 @NiallODowd Ignore it. Nobody thinks the famine is funny in itself. Not for a second.

It's why I said "and famines", not "including famines". The point - as I'm sure your clever enough to grasp,|||||@NiallODowd @joshglancy is that no topic should be so venerated as to not be open to examination through song, drama, comedy etc. What|||||@NiallODowd @joshglancy happened today is a different part of the same "outrage" wedge that led to calls to stop  the famine sitcom.|||||@HisEmineminence @joshglancy  oh God thats a stretch.

Think. @Seggitorial|||||@MevlutTatliyer she highlighted it because she lives in America where there is a narrative saying that Muslims should apologise for attacks|||||@MevlutTatliyer + and she highlighted it to say she rejected it.|||||Exactly.

The others terrorists that she just made @Seggitorial|||||@MevlutTatliyer no not really.|||||Muslims dont have to say anything about this attack.

1740	3	So now let's talk seriously about #CharlieHebdo and Western double standard on freedom of speech. #JenesuisPAScharlie http://t.co/XzsJQF12Uv|||||@Pray4Pal It is this hypocrisy and double standard|||||@Pray4Pal @Slippery_Richie thank you best tweet of the day salaam|||||@Pray4Pal the killers were non muslims cause that was not Islam üíî|||||@Pray4Pal @arqueoleg you mean #CharlieHebdo didn't draw about Jews or Christians?|||||@Pray4Pal  trur|||||@Pray4Pal true|||||@Pray4Pal &lt;Yes lets! Note how Muslims murdering Jews isn't a game changer, but murder of French journos is. @Hongosenlospies|||||@Pray4Pal @yorkstig They had many drawings of hook nosed Jews though!|||||@Pray4Pal &lt;Here on Earth, ppl have gone out of their way not to offend oversensitive Muslims. Why? they still complain. Ingrates!|||||@Pray4Pal Muslims: so delicate, and tender, like fluffy bunnies with AKs. So picked on. So, lets give them something to really cry about!|||||@Pray4Pal  This is your god: üí©! Here is your prophet: üêñ! You got a problem w that? That's YOUR PROBLEM!|||||@Pray4Pal not true. That paper poked fun at Jews too|||||@Pray4Pal @TheDudeInSF The cartoon forgets one important thing: No one murdered them for anti semitism.|||||@Pray4Pal @TheDudeInSF Free speech doesn't mean we have to agree with them. Just that they shouldn't be murdered for it.|||||@Pray4Pal @TheDudeInSF So it isn't a double standard to defend speech (even abhorrent speech) from murderous lunatics.|||||So you only object when #CharlieHebdo lampoons Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism or Judaism? @Pray4Pal @lousycanuck|||||@anarchic_teapot @Pray4Pal I think the point is that it's all objectionable, but the West doesn't generally object to islamophobic nonsense|||||@lousycanuck @Pray4Pal Fair enough. Trouble is, I've getting a lot of the other sort of idiot today.|||||@Pray4Pal @anarchic_teapot  What fucking bullshit. That newppaper had anti Semitic cartoons too. Did Jews murder the journalists?   NO|||||@ISIS_CRIMES @Pray4Pal They were murdered by fanatics. The religion is of little import.|||||@anarchic_teapot @Pray4Pal  Eh?  Little importance? ? They shouted "in Allah's name"  The whole motive was religious ffs!|||||@ISIS_CRIMES @Pray4Pal It just happened to be Islamists. Could also have been any extreme right wing political group.|||||@anarchic_teapot @Pray4Pal  Ffs come one. Don't u read the news? there is a v strong trend of terrorist offences Its not right wing loonies|||||@ISIS_CRIMES @Pray4Pal Ah, so it wasn't RW loonies that have twice attacked our LGBT centre and left neonazi scrawls on the walls. Gotcha.|||||@anarchic_teapot @Pray4Pal  Ur comparing nazi memorabilia on walls to cold blooded murders in Paris sydney Nigeria Iraq Syria?R u retarded?|||||No, but I've suspected you are for some time. This clinches it. @ISIS_CRIMES @Pray4Pal|||||@anarchic_teapot @Pray4Pal  It clinches ur an idiot. The comparison is pathetic|||||@Pray4Pal Take Westborough Baptist Church for example. Few people agree with them, but not many would advocate their murder.

Engage with me or don't, but don't hide behind indignation because I liked another tweet.|||||@janetravers It came moments after perfectly respectful interaction, so the juxtaposition was discomforting.|||||@MariaLaoise as you said yourself, my conversation with you was perfectly respectful.

I take ppl as I find them. I would prefer if you held off on thinking me awful until I tweet something ...|||||@janetravers ... that gives you cause to do so.|||||@MariaLaoise I disagree with just about everything I've ever seen you tweet. However, I believe in free speech and have never insulted you.|||||@MariaLaoise ...so I've had plenty of 'just cause' as you put it, but I won't belittle myself by insulting you personally. Now, free speech?|||||@janetravers I'll don't have time to fully flesh out my position now. My basic point would be that one can defend freedom of speech ...|||||@janetravers ... w/o celebrating speech that is problematic. Many Charlie cartoons fail into that category, IMO.|||||@MariaLaoise define problematic? If speech was only free if it said non-problematic things the world would never change.what'd be the point?|||||@janetravers I have no idea why you felt the need to tweet that to all your followers rather than simply reply to me.|||||@MariaLaoise because Twitter is a large, inclusive, worldwide conversation and I like to get other points of view.

1829	3	12 shocking #CharlieHebdo covers from Muhammad to Michael Jackson http://t.co/sT93i3WTWi http://t.co/flEmCiRds2|||||@thedailybeast @holysmoke Shocking?|||||@thedailybeast regardless of circumstance, I think it is wrong to republish offensive caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast why?|||||@AllenStarr1 @thedailybeast because they are crass, Islamophobic and serve only to inflame tensions. Have some respect.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Why?|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast The problem is with the people that take offense. They are clearly mentally unstable.|||||@AllenStarr1 @thedailybeast absolutely wrong. It is codified in Islam that depictions of God or the Prophet are forbidden.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast But we're not muslim. Don't you get that?|||||@AllenStarr1 @thedailybeast uh huh, but it is not irrational as u claimed to be offended by them. And I take issue with the insensitivity.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast As I said, mentally unstable to kill non-muslims for doing something that the are not forbidden to do.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast And this ... http://t.co/GOirTH9P2q|||||@AllenStarr1 @thedailybeast you're a racist, Islamophobic moron. You and the terrorists are 2 sides of the same coin. Blocked.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast So shove this where the sun doesn't shine ... http://t.co/QjdOAprdcC|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast the offended have the problem. They could choose not to be.|||||@SlagBass @thedailybeast the cartoons are designed to be as provocative as possible, as you are well aware.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast and the bigger man is not provoked|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast people really need to get a grip. All religion deserves ridicule.|||||@SlagBass @thedailybeast the 'bigger man' doesn't create or publish this type of trash in the first place. 2 wrongs don't make a right.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast  It's religion. it's ridiculous - it deserves to be ridiculed. There really is no need for imaginary friends|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Sorry, but it is exactly the circumstances that warrant it--we don't want to be intimidated into silence.|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast Tensions are extremely high and the cartoons are offensive. This is a time to talk peace, not share provocations.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Except satire, unlike men with automatic weapons, is not an act of non-peace.|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast hate speech isn't an act of peace. I'd call u a bully but ur not, ur just the buillies' laugh-along sidekick.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Satire is not hate speech. And how is a guy with a pen more of a bully than a guy with a gun?|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast I never said he was. But I'm glad you can recognise their similarities.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast What similarities?You must be trolling. You really want to compare being 'offended' to being savagely killed?|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast Not really. But what I'm saying is the killings don't retrospectively justify the provocations.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast But the entire point of satire IS being provocative. Banning 'offensiveness' is banning free speech.Gotta go.|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast not sure about banning it, but just because something's legal doesn't make it moral.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast But offensiveness IS NOT and CAN NOT be the measure of morality.Ugly world that would be: where would it end?|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast not saying nothing should ever be offensive, I'm saying caricaturing the Prophet is way over line of acceptability.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Why? what makes Mohammed (or any other prophet) so special? My point exactly: https://t.co/wSBJZdDlHe|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Evolution is 'way over the line of acceptability' for creationists, should we stop teaching it?|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast It's not the same. Criticising Islam is 1 thing, publishing caricatures of Muhammad is a no-no.|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast Sorry I was unclear there. I'm not saying never be offensive, but those cartoons are way way too far.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast You still haven't explained why we should care about Muslim no-nos (more than creationst no-nos?).|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast it's a dumb comparison|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast What is? Please answer, why should we give a damn what Muslims find offensive? or any other religious group?|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast Cos they're human beings &amp; there's no need to be a douche? Ur a bigot, no better than a high school bully.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Nobody forces Muslims to read Charlie Hebdo, why should freedom of speech be limited on their account?|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast And, should I close my twitter account should someone find that women speaking their mind is 'offensive'?|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast Nope. I'm just asking people to be considerate of the world's 1 billion+ Muslims &amp; not share those cartoons.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast Lots of people are offended by a lot of different things--do you eat pork? are you going to stop soon?|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast no, but I don't go and stick a photo of me eating a bacon sandwich on my neighbour's door.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast And how would that be satire? Again, satire &lt;&gt; hate speech/provocation.|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast it wouldn't be as offensive as publishing a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad.|||||@James__Nesbitt @thedailybeast The point is, no one has the right to kill/silence you for being offensive (unless they win a fair lawsuit).|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast think I missed the joke on the lawsuit bit, but otherwise I completely agree with you there.|||||@fdeperis @thedailybeast ok now I get it, they can silence you if they win a lawsuit. Not kill you though!|||||‚Äú@thedailybeast:12 shocking #CharlieHebdo covers from Muhammad to Michael Jackson http://t.co/7TnbRy6yGB http://t.co/FeLfcfQAks‚Äù click bait!|||||@thedailybeast @arctichamster Satirizing ridiculous, violent religious beliefs is not "shocking".

Have you ever seen the mascot of the Cleveland Indians? OR Any other cartoon? hardly racist..|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate Can I draw a cartoon to mock the Holocaust?|||||@jkbutstill @Slate YES!!! you can! that's the glory of #freespeech You can draw or say what ever you want!|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate Tell that to Charlie Hebdo, who fired someone for being antisemetic|||||@jkbutstill @Slate Its free speech, not consequence-free speech. If the owner is Jewish and doesn't like what was said, he can fire them.|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate Not exactly that free though, huh? Just as the owner is offended, so are others. It's hypocritical. And wrong|||||@jkbutstill @Slate Being fired, is better than being fired at, no?|||||‚Äú@AmeriCanadian1: @jkbutstill @Slate Being fired, is better than being fired at, no?‚Äù Both are still wrong.|||||@jkbutstill @Slate Let me explain how this works; you are free to say what you will, other are free to hold you accountable.|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate Isn't that what I'm doing? What's the problem here?|||||@jkbutstill @Slate I don't have a problem with anything you said. I just asked you where you saw racism in a cartoon. Conversation ensued.|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate Muslims are treated as a race (hence why brown non-Muslims are attacked in hate crimes). So this is racist|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate because it is anti-Islam. Just like something is labeled antisemitic if it is anti-Judaism|||||@jkbutstill @Slate So what?!! I was raised a Christian. You can say whatever you want about my faith and it won't change how I feel about it|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate That doesn't mean I feel the same way about mine. Also, hate against Christians can't be compared to that against us|||||@jkbutstill @AmeriCanadian1 @Slate religion is a choice, and choices are open for criticism. Religion is not a race.|||||@joeldsouza0 @AmeriCanadian1 @Slate When white women put on hijab, they lose their white privilege for this reason.|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate Hatred against Muslims comes with certain threats and consequences that hatred against Christians doesn't come with|||||@jkbutstill @Slate I call BS! What about the Coptic Christians in Egypt? Or the Chaldeans formally from Iraq? Our hate doesn't kill.|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate "Our hate doesn't kill."  No it does. It bombs, vandalized, attacks, discriminates. But it's not newsworthy|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate People can do anything they want that doesn't hurt others without fear of being killed. But it's still wrong|||||@AmeriCanadian1 @Slate It doesn't matter what the medium is. It's still racist|||||@Slate R.I.P Charlie Hebdo... You will be missed by many..

You become the same as them. But, you don't silence yourself.|||||@MARKT11 @MatthewdAncona yeah, I agree. But these butchers will keep coming with these random attacks.|||||@SiUttley @MatthewdAncona Yes they will...that's the world we're always in: personal choices-actions-consequences...and me?|||||@MARKT11 @MatthewdAncona random in the sense of being seemingly out of the blue. This would appear to be targeted.|||||@SiUttley @MatthewdAncona Wish every human treated each other as they wish to be treated, REAL SIMPLE LIFE, but....|||||@SiUttley @MatthewdAncona MUSLIM "extreme fundamentalist" is as deadly as "CHRISTIAN extreme fuundamentalist" blowing up abortion clinics|||||@MARKT11 and every atrocity by any extremist should be condemned equally.|||||@SiUttley @MatthewdAncona But...EXTREMEIST on both sifdes of anything...usually taught that way as kids.|||||@MARKT11 absolutely.
